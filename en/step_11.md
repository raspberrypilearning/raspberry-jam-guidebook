## Chapter Eight: Developing your Jam

### Managing growth

When you've run a few events, and word of your Jam has spread, you may find that your tickets sell out quickly. You may find that you are turning away large numbers of people who would like to attend. You need to manage this growth while maintaining the quality of your events. You could consider:

**Moving to a bigger venue**

If your venue has a capacity of 30, but you have 100 people who want to attend, you could look for a venue large enough for 100 people. However, this means that you will be running a much larger event. Will you still be able to provide practical activities for this many people? Would you still be able to run it every month? Will people still enjoy it?

**Running your event more often**

If you are running your Jam every two or three months, running events more regularly could both increase your reach and reduce the demand for tickets.

**Setting up more events in your area**

If your Jam is the only one in your region, helping someone to set up a second event might take the pressure off your Jam, and give your attendees a choice of events to go to. You could work with helpers and volunteers to set up other Jams in your region. There is no single correct way to develop your Jam. Think about what works for you and your participants, and look for ways to include more people in Jam events. Talk to other Jam organisers about how their events have developed over time. Ask your attendees what developments they would like to see, and ask your volunteers what growth they would be willing to support.

###Case study: development and growth

**Manchester Raspberry Jam**

Manchester Raspberry Jam ran its first event in June 2012, and has run events in most months since then. It started as a small Jam of about 25 people in a tech community space in the early days of Raspberry Pi. It was designed for Raspberry Pi users to come together and learn about what could be done with the Pi, and attendees would usually work on their own projects. The Jam had no equipment, so attendees were asked to bring their own monitors, mice, keyboards, and other equipment from home.

Free tickets were released on Eventbrite, and sponsorship money, donated by local companies and attendees, went towards buying pizza on the day of the event. Manchester has a thriving tech scene, with plenty of user groups and meetups, so we spread the word among those groups. The events were attended by a mix of tech professionals of all ages, as well as parents, kids, and teachers. Parents would work on projects with their children, and keen teachers would come along to learn about coding
and making from other Raspberry Pi users.

Over time, the Jam grew, and it soon extended into the upstairs part of the venue. We filled all the available space, which doubled the capacity of the event. At its fullest, close to 100 people attended the Jam. Eventually, the Jam found a new venue with more space at the university, allowing the organisers to open the event up to a larger number of people, and provide space for workshops as well as freeform hacking. Over time, the Jam has collected money from ticket sales and sponsorship, which has allowed them to purchase their own equipment. Jam equipment, as well as donated hardware, allows them provide Raspberry Pi setups at Jam events for people who don't have their own.

### Case study: developing diversity

**South London Raspberry Jam**

One of the big things that has come up for us so far is looking at access, diversity, and equality in terms of delivering events and workshops. When we've run our big events, we've really been successful in introducing coding to a wide group of people. We've done a lot of outreach work as well. We've made partnerships with Tourettes Action and Autism organisations, so they advertise what we're doing in their networks. We've been been providing Autism and Tourettes sponsored tickets on Eventbrite, because the parents of those kids tend to be more cautious. Because our tickets go really quickly, we make sure some of these tickets are set aside so parents can take their time deciding whether they want to come.

We've been working in local communities, talking to kids who've been excluded. We talk about what we're doing and ask the parents if they want to come along along. Many people don't think that this is for them, but that personal invitation helps us to build a relationship with them.

There are great parent-child pairs that work together in our Jams. We're starting with Astro Pi and Pioneers, and the parents have been fantastic. It's been a really good experience for everyone, as the parent is able to give the child one-to-one attention. You can't drop your kids off and go shopping, and expect your kid to have the same experience as another child who's got a parent with them. Some parents think this isn't for them, because they feel they're not techy enough, but this can be a great learning opportunity for them, too. Touching base with people like that on an individual basis is important: when they do come, they tend to enjoy it. We even give some of the older kids the opportunity to run workshops for the parents.
