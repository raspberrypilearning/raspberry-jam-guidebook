## Chapter One: Getting started

### Building your team

Running a Raspberry Jam does not have to be a one-person operation. If you are working on this alone, try to find some helpers. Look for other people interested in running a Jam, and involve them in planning the event. Ask around for volunteers to help on the day, or to help set up the venue before the event. People will be willing to help: they just need an invitation. Find jobs for your helpers, ask them for their advice to help you make decisions, and involve them in coordinating the event.

*To find adults who are good at Raspberry Pi, we started looking at Linux groups, techy companies, and developer meetups. We've run coding evenings for teachers and Code Club volunteers, who obviously already have experience with this. Ham radio groups are usually interested, and have good skills too. We also get all the children to bring their parents: some of the parents are quite techy, and willing to help.*

###Finding a venue

Finding a venue is an important step in the planning of your Jam. If you are just getting started, you don't need to find a permanent venue. At this point, your aim is to run your first event. If you need a bigger venue in the future, you can look for one then. Many Jams begin with a small number of people, and grow into a larger event later. You should choose a venue that is
easy to reach by public transport. Ideally, your venue will also be accessible to people who use mobility aids.

When you are looking for a venue, consider the following options in your area:

- libraries
- makerspaces
- schools, universities, and colleges

Try to find out where other groups in your area meet up. Use websites such as Eventbrite and Meetup to locate suitable venues.

Try to find a venue that will be free of charge to use. Some Jams do have to pay for their venues, but this requires fundraising and can be hard to sustain. If the venue usually charges for bookings, they may allow you to hold your Jam free of charge if you explain that it is a community meeting, rather than a commercial event.

Alternatively, you could offer to donate all proceeds from the Jam to the venue to help cover their costs. Charge a small amount for tickets, or ask for donations on the day. You can find more information on issuing tickets in Chapter Two.

*Universities make good venues. They have a lot of different buildings, a lot of different spaces, and you may find that you can use the different spaces in unique ways.*

*I got one of the first Raspberry Pis and was looking to find other people like me who had little experience of programming and Linux to help and support each other. I approached the library to see if they would give us the space and they agreed.*

**Simon Belshaw** — Exeter Raspberry Jam

*Our local library gave us a venue free of charge: they're just pleased that someone is using the space.*

**Cat Lamin** — Wimbledon Raspberry Jam

*I heard about coding coming into schools and that was really the start of it. At the time, I was asked to run an event to encourage more men and boys into the library. This ended up being a great event for people of all ages: the public seem to love the event!*

### Naming your Jam

Choosing a name for your Jam is an important part of your planning process. It is best to include your location in the name, but think carefully about the area you serve or represent. Don't be too broad. For example, calling yourself 'London Raspberry Jam' would make it look as if you are the only Raspberry Jam in London. Be consistent in the use of your Jam name. If you are the Sunnydale Jam, stick to 'Sunnydale Jam'. Don't be tempted to refer to yourselves as the 'Santa Barbara County Jam' or the 'California Jam' for different events. You don't have to use the word 'Jam'. If your event is a different style of meetup, another name might be more appropriate. An adult-focused tech meetup could be called '[Location] Raspberry Pi User Group', or a pub meetup could be called '[Location] Raspberry Pint'. Don't let a different name stop you from engaging with the Jam community. All Raspberry Pi community events can learn from each other, and all are welcome on the Jam map.

At this point it might be a good idea to set up an email address for your Jam. You can use this to answer queries from attendees and to set up accounts with Eventbrite and social media platforms later.

###Support

Remember: when you are organising a Jam, you are not alone. There are many other people in the Raspberry Pi community with experience of running events. Reach out to them to ask for help, to share your ideas, and to ask for advice.

There are two online communities you can join to network with other Jam organisers. Slack is a fast-paced instant chat platform, with chat channels, direct messages, and groups. Google+ is a slower-paced platform with a single stream of longer-form posts. Both communities are private and require membership to be granted. Send an email to jam@raspberrypi.org to request invitations to join.

It can be very helpful to meet other Jam organisers, especially when you are getting started. Take a look at the Jam map at rpf.io/jam and find another Jam to attend. Contact the Jam organiser and explain that you are planning to start your own Jam. Give yourself a chance to ask questions and share your ideas with them. Don't fixate on trying to match exactly what the other Jam does: do what you think is suitable and manageable for you and your Jam.

Make an effort to find out what else is going on in your area. Are there any local Code Clubs? Is there a CoderDojo or similar organisation? Is there a hackerspace, or a tech community space? Are there tech user groups? Reach out to the people behind these events. Can you work together to promote your Jam? Can you make use of each other's resources or experience? If you're in the UK, contact the Code Club regional coordinator in your area and let them know what you are planning. Code Club is a programme run by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, so they will definitely be interested in hearing about your event.

*You'll find that a lot of the people who attend your first Jam will become your future volunteers.*

*I really enjoy the challenge, I meet great people, and the maker crowd are fantastic and really supportive. I also enjoy networking with people and local companies. It is great for the library, and for my own skills development.*

### Lead times

People who run big Jams usually give themselves a couple of months to plan everything, as there's a lot to organise when you're arranging talks, workshops, and volunteers. Smaller Jams with fewer activities don't take as much planning, but it's important to give yourself plenty of time for everything to come together, and to deal with contingencies. Most Jams make their tickets available a month or so before their event. This gives people the chance to plan their attendance in advance, and lets the organisers know how many attendees to expect.

If you have a regular Jam, it's useful if you are able to keep it to a certain day: you might decide to hold your Jam on, for example, the first Saturday of each month. That allows people to plan ahead, and ensures they know when to expect the Jam to take place. If possible, book your regular dates with your venue in advance. Make the dates available to your attendees, perhaps on your website.

### Raspberry Jam starter kit

Once you have announced your first event, go to rpf.io/jamkit to request your Raspberry Jam starter kit from the Foundation. Your kit will contain flyers, sets of stickers, magazines, printed worksheets, and more! You'll also receive a pack of design assets and templates to help you make your own posters and other resources.

### Checklist

Check that you have:

- recruited a team of volunteers to help you run the event
- booked a venue and a date for your first event
- chosen a name for your Jam
- allowed plenty of time to get everything planned
- applied for your Raspberry Jam starter kit

*Don't be afraid to start small: it helps you to gauge interest. Try somewhere out and find out what shape your Jam will eventually be.*

*If you want your Jam to be child friendly, involve a local school or teacher in the planning stage.*
