## Chapter Five: Money

### Financial management

It is your responsibility as the event organiser to make sure you are familiar with any regulations governing the management of funds for community groups in your region, and that you adhere to them in all respects. If you find yourself holding funds after your Jam, make sure you keep a careful record of income and outgoings. This is particularly important if you are holding funds in a personal bank account. Use a spreadsheet to identify how much money belongs to the Jam, and make sure you don't end up spending your own money. The Resource Centre website offers advice on taking care of finances for a community group. If your Jam ends up generating a lot of revenue, think about keeping the Jam money separate from your private accounts. If your Jam is based at a school, university, library, or community space, you could ask them to hold the money for you, and make payments and purchases on your behalf. Alternatively, you could set up a community bank account. Some banks offer special accounts for small
voluntary and community organisations, which provide free banking as long as your account is in credit. Make sure you can easily transfer ownership of the account, money, and any equipment you own to someone new if you decide to hand over the running of the event.

Using bank accounts with multiple signatories, and keeping careful records of the ownership of equipment will help to make a handover more straightforward. If you cannot find anyone to take over the running of your Jam, contact the Community Manager at jam@raspberrypi.org for guidance. We suggest that you pass on any assets to another Jam in your area.

A bank account is something we have been looking into for a while. We looked around the major banks and shortlisted it down to two. These banks both offer free community bank accounts that are basically business bank accounts, free of charge for not-for-profit community organisations.

*We ended up choosing the bank whose application process could be completed online. The process involved filling out a long webbased application form, covering everything from the purpose of your organisation and uploading a formal rules and regulations document, to your tax status, and so on. For any section we weren't sure about, we simply gave them a call and queried it. The entire process took about a month, with the result being a full business bank account with debit cards and a chequebook, and the option to require everything to be countersigned. This is certainly a time-consuming process if your Jam isn't an official organisation, but being able to manage the Jam's money from a central location is something that will pay off in the long term, especially if there are ever any questions asked about where donations and funds have been spent.*

*The venue I used for the Manchester Jam was a community space which held other tech meetups. Since we used the whole venue for a whole day, I offered to donate all the ticket money to them, to put towards their running costs. Any extra donations or sponsorship we got, I put towards buying pizza at the event, and any surplus I saved, keeping track of how much we had. When it built up to about £200, I decided to buy some Raspberry Pis for the Jam. When I moved away from Manchester, I agreed to hand over the event organisation to one of my volunteers, and I left him with the remaining balance.*

*Between the two of us, we looked at our own personal banks to see what options were available. We decided that, seeing as I do most of the paperwork, we should go with my bank. They required lots of forms of identification and other paperwork, as well as a personal meeting with a banker. It took them a while to sort everything out, but we're much happier now that the money goes directly into that account. It helps keep us organised!*

### Fundraising

If your Jam runs regularly, it provides both an incentive and an opportunity to raise funds. If you take in more than you need, you can keep the remainder as a float for the Jam. You can use this to cover future costs, or save it to buy equipment for the Jam. If you find that your Jam would benefit from buying some equipment, and your leftover ticket money isn't enough to cover what you need, you might want to consider doing some fundraising. A simple option is to ask for donations, using a ‘donation' ticket type, or even having a donation tin at the event. Alternatively, you could run a crowdfunding campaign to raise awareness of your group's community activities, and ask for donations to provide more opportunities to local kids.

You could even organise an old-fashioned fundraiser, like a sponsored walk or a cake sale! If you can get all your members involved, they can help to promote the community message.

*In order to avoid charging for tickets, we always hold a raffle and raise between £60 and £200, and everyone's happy whether they win or not. You can use Twitter to ask for swag from the community, to give away as prizes. It's so nice to be able to run community events which are free to attend.*

We hand out free raffle tickets while we shake the donation tin. Then we pull winning tickets from a box and they win a prize we've had donated, like a HAT or something.

We have some SD cards which we loan out for the afternoon, and other cards which we sell at a small profit. If you can find a cheap source of decent blank SD cards, then it's a good way to raise funds while also solving a big problem.

### Sponsorship

Another approach is to contact companies and organisations to ask for sponsorship for your event. You may find that local technology companies are willing to sponsor your event as part of their corporate social responsibility and community outreach initiatives. Tech firms are likely to want to encourage the teaching of digital skills in the local area.

The best way to approach a company for sponsorship is to specify an aspect of the event to be supported by their funds. You can't expect them to cover all your costs, but if you have something in mind that they can contribute to, this will help. Good examples include buying pizza for the event, or buying a set of Raspberry Pis for workshops.

Be grateful for any donations or sponsorship you receive, and be sure to thank the donors privately and publicly. A "thank you" tweet from your Jam's account will be well received, and companies will appreciate the publicity. Encourage attendees to retweet, and to add their own thanks to your message.

As well as local companies, you could approach Raspberry Pi retailers to ask whether they would sponsor an event. If you can give them space to promote or sell their products, they may find sponsorship to be a very worthwhile gesture. Note that if you are planning to allow companies to sell products at the event, you should check this with your venue first.

If you ask a company for sponsorship and they say no, be polite and move on. You may approach a company that has sponsored other events, and find that they refuse when you ask. Don't take offence, as this could simply mean that they have spent their sponsorship budget for the year.

*Initially, my son Femi ran a highly successful crowdfunding campaign using Indiegogo, by producing a one-minute film about what he wanted to do and the equipment he would need. We set the target at £500 over a two-week period. We got that in four days, and went on to raise £1,270 which has lasted us for 18 months.*

*We went to all the Jams we could, and Femi did talks at places like CamJam and PyCon. We've had donations of kit from Raspberry Pi retailers. It's really important not to overdo the amount you aim to collect. The key thing is to meet people in person, build up a relationship, and always send thanks via Twitter and blog posts. You really shouldn't automatically expect companies to donate supplies to you, but be really grateful when they do.*
