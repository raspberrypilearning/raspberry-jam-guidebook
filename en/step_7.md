## Chapter Four: Running a safe Jam

CHAPTER FOUR: RUNNING A SAFE JAM

It's important that the event you run is safe to attend for everyone,
paying particular attention to the needs of people under 18 and
vulnerable adults. It is your responsibility as event organiser to
make sure you are familiar with the legislation governing your
region and that you adhere to it in all respects.

Start every event by explaining where the fire exits are, and where
people should assemble in the event of a fire alarm. Talk to your
volunteers and discuss how you would help a wheelchair user
evacuate. Usually the plan is that someone stays with them to help
them evacuate last, so they get a clear path and other people don't
trip over them. Some buildings have a wheelchair refuge area with a
communication panel: make sure you know where it is.

It's handy to point out the fire exits, toilets, catering, and the like while
you're welcoming people. If you're not doing an opening talk, then ask
your check-in volunteers to point these out as people walk in.

Risk assessment

PI

Your venue may ask you to complete a risk assessment. Some venues may provide
examples and templates to help you with this task. If you are planning activities that
involve increased risk to participants, such as soldering, you will need to think about
safety precautions. You should plan to provide warnings, explain the dangers, and
give sufficient training to anyone wishing to take part.
Be aware that your participants may bring their own projects. Use your risk
assessment to develop a plan for checking their equipment and ensuring that their
activities are safe.

Unless required by your venue, your risk assessment does not need to be a formal
document. Aim to put together a common-sense approach to assessing situations,
ensuring that your activities are not putting people in danger, and making sensible
decisions to minimise risk.
For more information, see the Resource Centre website. This provides plenty of
resources to help with compiling risk assessments, including templates and advice.

REMEMBER: "Risk assessment is about achieving a balance between a reasonable
level of risk, and being able to get on with organising your activities. Remember,
no activity is completely free from risk, and doing a risk assessment is not about
making your activities risk-free."
- Resource Centre

Our venue, a university, required us to perform a risk assessment
and have public liability insurance. I had experience with risk
assessments from work, so that was straightforward, but anyone
who doesn't have that experience can find plenty of examples
online. Alternatively, ask someone at your venue to help you fill it
out: it should only take twenty minutes. You just need to think of
the top ten â€˜what ifs' and give sensible solutions. We bought public
liability insurance through events-insurance.co.uk. Remember to
buy it only for the days of your events, not all year round!

We were asked to do a risk
assessment for the Institute
of Astronomy when we
wanted to start introducing
soldering workshops. We
needed to think carefully
about all the potential
risks and work out how we
mitigate them. In the case
of soldering, we needed a
bucket of water for burns
and a first aider on hand, just
in case.

I hold a monthly Jam at
the Raspberry Pi offices in
Cambridge, where we have a
perfectly suitable space to run
a Jam. I discussed it with our
office manager and operations
director, who helped me
calculate the maximum capacity
of the space, and go over any
precautions or risks we should
consider. They were really
helpful and made it so much
easier to plan my first event.

Safeguarding
Raspberry Jams should be creative, fun, and safe places for adults and children to
learn, and to meet other makers. As the event organiser, you should take reasonable
precautions to ensure that all attendees and staff are kept safe. You should ensure
that children attending your event are not left unsupervised, and that parents stay
with their children.

Any adults at your event must:
never be left alone with young people or
vulnerable adults
take care not to have physical contact with young
people or vulnerable adults attending the event
not take or share photos of others without
appropriate permission

Your venue may have a safeguarding policy. Ask to see it, and follow any guidelines
it provides.

Although most of our volunteers are DBS-cleared through other
voluntary work, we made a conscious decision that we wanted
parents to remain with their children. The responsible adult does
not need their own ticket, but requiring parents or guardians to
accompany their children removes the need for DBS paperwork,
and means that every child has a familiar authority figure on hand.
We also find that children are more focused in the workshops when
their parents are around.
