## Chapter Two: The next steps

### Planning your activities

The activities you provide will set the tone for your Jam. Do you want to put on workshops, arrange talks, or invite people to showcase their personal projects? Before you start planning your activities, think about what would be suitable for your event. If you are new to running Jams, it might be best to start with simple activities, and introduce a more complicated programme for later events. Don't feel that you have to provide workshops and talks because you've seen them at other Jams. Do what works for you to get your Jam up and running. You can find more information on Raspberry Jam activities in Chapter Three.

REMEMBER: you don't have to be the person who does everything and runs everything at the Jam. Put together a team of people willing to lead sessions and support your participants with their projects. The skills of the people you recruit will help to shape the programme for your event.

*We tend to visit other Jams to see what inspires us, we then approach that person to come and run the same workshop at our Jam. As time goes on, we will try to focus on more children giving the workshops.*

Ticketing

It is a good idea to set up a ticketing system for attendees. This allows you to keep track of the number of people planning to attend, keep in contact with them before and after the event, and manage attendance on the day. Most Jams use Eventbrite for their ticketing: take a look at the Eventbrite pages of the events on the Raspberry Jam map. Eventbrite can be used for ticketing a free event, but it also allows you to sell tickets. It is easy to set up an event page and start publicising your jam.

Start by creating an email account for your Jam, if you haven't done this already. Use this to create an Eventbrite account for your Jam. Create an event; provide the date, time, location and other information; and create some tickets. You could provide adult tickets and child tickets, or morning and afternoon tickets. Eventbrite allows attendees to choose between registering for a free ticket, or paying a small donation to the Jam. Your Eventbrite page could function as the home page for your first event.

###Ticketing your Jam with Eventbrite

1. Set up an Eventbrite account for your Jam
2. Create your event
3. Create tickets
4. Make your event live
5. Share your ticket link online

Ideally your event will be free to attend for everyone, but this is not always possible. If you have costs to cover, such as venue hire, you will need to find a way to pay for this. Charging a small amount for tickets is a fair way of covering your costs. Consider running your first event in a free venue, and moving to another venue later if necessary. Take any costs you incur into account, consider the number of people you are expecting, and work out how much you need to charge. Jams in the UK often charge around £5 for tickets, but you'll know what's right for your region and your community.

We encourage you to provide free tickets to children, and to cover your costs by charging for adult tickets. You may also choose to make free tickets available to students, and to out-of-work adults. If you have costs to cover, finding a way to balance freebies with paid tickets can be tricky, but free tickets can dramatically lower the barrier to entry for some groups of people.

Note that Jams with ticket prices of more than a small nominal fee will not be listed on the Foundation's website. We make an exception for events where these tickets are optional, and include the purchase of hardware. Free or cheap tickets must also be available.

As an alternative to charging for tickets, you could ask for donations. This could take the form of a 'pay what you want' ticketing system, a donation option on your Eventbrite page, or a collection at the event.

Jams often charge for tickets, but you'll know what's right for your region and your community.

*We use Eventbrite. It's pretty simple. We have it set up so that we have two batches of tickets up at once, for the next two events. We have our mailing list, so we let people know when the tickets go up, as well as sending information about what we're up to. We have 'attendee' tickets, for people who are going to take part, and 'parents, guardians, and other', for people who don't need access to a Pi. The tickets are all free, and we put out about 15 percent extra tickets, in case people don't show up.*

*We make sure free tickets are always available for those who need them.*

*We issue an 'optional donation' ticket with a suggested donation of £3 per person, or £5 if attending a workshop, but we make it very clear that it is entirely optional. We then also go round and shake a tin about half an hour before the end.*

### Promotion

When you have set up your ticketing page, you need to tell people about it. Think about who you want to attend your event, who might want to come, and how you can reach them.

The first step is to submit your Jam to the Raspberry Pi website. If it is a Raspberry Pi-focused event that is free or cheap to attend, it will appear on the Jam map and in the calendar. Note that it may take the community team a couple of working days to moderate your submission.

### More promotion ideas

Ask the venue to promote your event. Set up a Twitter account for the Jam and tweet about the event. Mention `@Raspberry_Pi` and use the `#rjam` hashtag. Ask other nearby Jams to tweet about your Jam, or tell people on their mailing list about your event.

If you are in the UK, contact your local Code Club regional coordinator and ask them to promote your Jam to local Code Clubs.

Contact the organisers of other local tech events and ask them to spread the word. Look for CoderDojos, hackerspaces, user groups, and other meetings. Publicise your event in local newspapers, on community boards in shops and libraries, on local news websites, and on local event listing websites. Tell your local school, college, or university about your event, and ask them to share the details with their students. Create a mailing list for your Jam using MailChimp or similar. Invite people to register for updates about your events.

*When promoting your event, keep it local. A local radio or newspaper feature is worth a dozen international TV slots. Nobody watching in California is going to make the trip to Cheltenham, whereas quite a lot of mums and dads reading the Gloucestershire Echo might take their kids along to our events.*

*I use Twitter and Facebook. I've found it useful to get the message directly to schools who use Twitter, so the IT specialist can pass the message on to parents and children. I think old-fashioned posters put up around the area work well too.*

### Kit

If you are planning to run practical Raspberry Pi activities at your Jam, we recommend providing some basic kit. You don't have to buy any kit to get started: you can ask attendees to bring their own kit from home. If your venue offers PC suites, use the monitors and ask people to bring their own Raspberry Pis and peripherals. Alternatively, contact the organisers of other Jams and ask to borrow their kit for your first event.

Essential Raspberry Pi setup:

- Raspberry Pi 3
- SD card
- power supply
- monitor
- HDMI cable
- USB mouse and keyboard

We suggest you provide the listed kit to each participant in your activity.

Additional accessories:

- pi-topCEED (if monitors are not available at the venue)
- Raspberry Pi case

Activity-specific kit:

- Electronics kit e.g. CamJam EduKits or Pi-Stop
- Camera Module
- HATs: e.g. Sense HAT, Traffic HAT, Explorer HAT
- headphones or speakers

*I duplicate plenty of micro SD cards with up-to-date Raspbian images and all the workshop files on. The trick is to use a USB 3.0 hub and duplicate SD cards ten at a time. If someone's attending a workshop and they've brought their own SD card, you can guarantee it will be out of date and won't have the software they need. We just have a bunch of SD cards ready to go. It's also handy to have a USB memory stick so people can transfer any files they make, and take a copy of their work home.*

*When I ran my first Jam in 2012, you could only buy one Raspberry Pi at a time, and you had to wait about three months. The Jam was essentially the 30 people in Manchester who were lucky enough to buy one on day one! Following that, more people managed to get hold of a Pi. It wasn't a problem that the Jam had no kit of its own: people were expected to bring their own. They were happy working on their own personal projects, and getting help from each other.*
