## Chapter Three: Running your activities

Your Jam could feature a range of activities. Here are a few ideas.

### Drop-in

**Organisation**: arrange tables, chairs, and power
**You will need**: tables and chairs, extension cables, monitors, worksheets (optional)
**People**: helpers on hand

A popular informal Jam activity is a drop-in. Provide people with space to work on their own projects, or to look online for something to make or learn. This might seem like something your attendees could do at home, but doing it at the Jam gives them the instant support of other community members. Running a drop-in is easy! You will need to provide tables, chairs, and electricity.

If your venue can give you access to a PC suite, participants can bring their own Raspberry Pis and connect them to the venue's monitors, mice, and keyboards. You may wish to provide printed worksheets for people who need guidance, or perhaps point them in the direction of some online resources. You should encourage collaboration, or even pair people up to work together.

If you're running a freeform drop-in practical session, make sure your attendees know in advance, so they can bring what they need to work on their projects.

### Show-and-tell

**Organisation**: call for participation, arrange space requirements
**You will need**: tables, extension cables, space for each project
**People**: exhibitors, helpers for setting up

A show-and-tell is a great activity for inspiring people to create their own projects. Invite people to bring their own projects along, demonstrate them to attendees, and talk to people about how they work. Demonstrating personal projects is a great way to show newcomers what the Raspberry Pi can do. Showcasing them gives a chance for people to ask the owners questions about the builds, and for the owners to share their experiences. It is a good idea to organise your show-and-tell in advance. This allows you to create a list of people and projects, and to plan your space accordingly.

You'll need to announce your show-and-tell, and make it easy for people to participate. If you are prepared to let anyone exhibit their project, then just a ticket type on Eventbrite may suffice. If you have limited space, you could ask people to apply to take part, so you can choose the most appropriate exhibitors. However you do this, you'll need to be in contact with exhibitors to make sure you know what space they need, and what other requirements they have (power, a projector, etc.).

Some show-and-tell projects may be particularly engaging. Robots that participants can control, or games that people can play are always popular, and make for great Jam entertainment.

###Workshops

**Organisation**: call for workshops, liaison with workshop leaders
**You will need**: Raspberry Pi setups, worksheets and/or presentations, additional hardware as required
**People**: workshop leaders and helpers

Workshops provide structured practical experiences for your participants. You will need to provide equipment, or ask participants to provide their own. Your workshop will need a leader. This could be you, or another organiser or helper. The workshop leader will need to plan their content carefully, and decide how they intend to deliver it. You could structure it around worksheets, a presentation, or both. Schedule your workshops with clear start and finish times.

Make sure you publicise the level of your workshop. If it is covering an entrylevel subject, make sure that your participants are aware that they don't need to know anything about the subject to take part. If your workshop is covering a more advanced subject, make sure that your participants understand what prior knowledge they will need before they sign up.

You may wish to create your own workshop materials. If you are looking for sample activities, we've provided a selection of short worksheets for you to use, and modify for your own purposes. You can find plenty more inspiration for workshop activities on the Raspberry Pi website. If you're creating your own worksheets, be sure to keep the steps easy to follow, and don't assume any prior knowledge for beginner activities.

Raspberry Jam short worksheets:

We have provided three short two-page worksheets, ideal for giving beginners a simple exercise to try at your Jam. They all work out of the box in Raspbian with no additional software requirements. Modding Minecraft with Python requires no additional hardware. Make random sparkles with the Sense HAT can be used with the web- or desktop-based emulators if you don't have a physical Sense HAT. Controlling a traffic light sequence with GPIO Zero requires a Pi-Stop traffic light board. It can also be used with LEDs on a breadboard.

REMEMBER: be sure to prepare your SD cards in advance with all the software you need for the workshop. Note the software requirements for the Raspberry Pi workshops and the Jam worksheets, and check any requirements with the workshop leaders. It is worth double-checking the SD cards to make sure they work as expected before the workshop.

### Talks

**Organisation**: call for speakers, liaison with speakers
**You will need**: projector and screen or wall, microphone and speaker system
**People**: speakers, volunteer room manager

Another formal activity to consider is a series of talks. These can be lengthy conference-style presentations, or on-the-spot lightning talks. Scheduled talks give attendees the chance to share something with the community: a project they've been working on, something they've learned, or an inspirational story.

If you are planning to run talks, you will need a space that is separate from the rest of your event so that the talk does not disrupt the other activities, and vice versa. You will need to provide a projector and a microphone. Ensure that each presenter is provided with the correct cables to connect their kit to the projector, and with anything else they need.

Talks don't have to be very long: a series of short 'lightning talks' can be a great wayto allow people to present their projects, or something they've learned and want to share. Talks of five, ten, or 15 minutes are a great way to give new speakers (perhaps young people) the chance to stand up and present on their chosen topic, without the need to prepare a long lecture.

*It's all down to what your intentions are for the Jam, what space you have in your venue, and what equipment you have available. For instance, for your first Jam, you may not have any kit and you may have a small venue, which dictates a mix of talks and/or show-and-tell. In larger venues, you potentially have more rooms to use, so you can expand into workshops (provided you can gather enough equipment together), more show-and-tell, and even a marketplace if you can persuade vendors to attend.*

**Michael Horne** — Cambridge Raspberry Jam

When I ran the Manchester Jam, people were happy to work on their own projects. Occasionally we ran a track of talks, or put on a workshop, which was a nice change. Now I run the Jam at Pi Towers, the attendees tended to be mostly beginners – usually parents with their children – so we mostly run workshops and hand out worksheets.

### More activity ideas

This is not an exhaustive list of the things that take place at Jams. For more ideas, talk to other Jam organisers. Some Jams invite retailers to sell Raspberry Pi accessories at the Jam. This can be an effective way for retailers to reach customers in the Raspberry Pi community. It is the perfect place for attendees to look at kit before they buy, and to put questions to the sellers in person. Make sure that retailers know you are looking for sellers for your Jam. Approach retailers directly, particularly local sellers. Look for contact information on retailers' websites, or reach out on Twitter.

Use beginner sessions to introduce newcomers to the Raspberry Pi for the first time. Some Jams run Q&A sessions for people new to the device. Others provide volunteers ready to work with people who turn up with a Raspberry Pi they haven't used yet, and help them get started.

Bigger Jams holding formal talks will sometimes host a panel session, giving the audience a chance to ask a group of experienced individuals questions on a particular topic.

A TeachMeet is an event where teachers gather to give short presentations to their peers and share ideas for teaching. Why not run a Raspberry Pifocused TeachMeet, with practical workshops and short presentations?

More information on organising a TeachMeet can be found on the Teacher Toolkit website.

Your Jam could promote participation in other Raspberry Pi programmes and competitions. Pioneers is aimed at teams of 12- to 15-year-olds, and Astro Pi is aimed at under-16s and their teachers. You can find information and resources for these programmes on the Raspberry Pi website.

Try using the Code Club material for beginners. Just register your Jam as a Code Club. First, register yourself as a host on the Code Club website. Find a volunteer willing to support nine- to eleven-year-olds to work on projects in Scratch, HTML, and Python. Register them as an official volunteer on the website, and your Code Club will be activated.

When a competition like Astro Pi, or a programme like Pioneers comes out, we'll do talks, and invite people along to take part in workshops at the Jam. It's good because it gives an incentive for people to come along and take part, and gives them motivation to work. We celebrate the entrants, and those who've won, and invite them to do talks. We ask them to mentor at future Raspberry Jams, or run workshops.

**Andy Melder** — Southend Raspberry Jam

Something like Astro Pi is a fantastic thing to get involved in if you want to really give children some focus and direction. The idea of having your code run on the International Space Station is a real motivator for young kids.
