## Foreword & Introduction

### Foreword

Raspberry Jams are something of a phenomenon. Independent and run by volunteers, they gather together people from all walks of life to celebrate the Raspberry Pi in particular, and digital making in general. They have spread throughout the world, from humble beginnings in the north of England to the Far East and North America, and they show no signs of slowing down.

The guide you are about to read is a compilation of advice from Raspberry Jam organisers throughout the UK, designed to help you run the best Jam you possibly can. It features sections on how to get started, planning your activities, safety and safeguarding, managing finances, planning and organisation, collecting feedback, and developing your Jam. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has gathered information vital to anyone who wants to run and develop a Raspberry Jam.

Jams are an expression of the Raspberry Pi community's support for the goals of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Jams help the people who attend to explore the world of digital making through the sharing of ideas, knowledge, expertise, and enthusiasm. As a Jam organiser, you are at the forefront of this quest to bring people together. In return, you can expect an immense amount of satisfaction from witnessing wonderful moments: when a child first turns on an LED and gasps; when an adult manages to explain something for the first time without using technical jargon; when that first solder joint looks perfect; when the first robot moves; and, most importantly, when anyone realises that they are not alone. You can also expect to be very busy, both in the lead-up to the event and on the day itself!

Our Jam in Cambridge started small, with just 30 people in one room. It has now grown to roughly 150-200 people per event. It has taken a lot of hard work and dedication to get it to this size. We have developed our Jam into other events: Pi Wars, a robotics competition, which this year took place over two days; and Potton Pi and Pints, which is a much smaller event held upstairs in a pub. All of these models work, as do many others. There are Jams taking place at work venues, universities, libraries, hackerspaces, conference centres, and even museums.

Each Jam has a different flavour, each Jam attracts a different group of people, and each Jam has a different buzz about it. As a Jam organiser, all you need now is enthusiasm and a desire to ask those vital questions: where will I hold my Raspberry Jam, and what will it look like?
