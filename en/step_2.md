## Foreword & Introduction

### Foreword

Raspberry Jams are something of a phenomenon. Independent and run by
volunteers, they gather together people from all walks of life to celebrate the
Raspberry Pi in particular, and digital making in general. They have spread
throughout the world, from humble beginnings in the north of England to the
Far East and North America, and they show no signs of slowing down.

The guide you are about to read is a compilation of advice from Raspberry Jam
organisers throughout the UK, designed to help you run the best Jam you possibly
can. It features sections on how to get started, planning your activities, safety and
safeguarding, managing finances, planning and organisation, collecting feedback,
and developing your Jam. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has gathered information
vital to anyone who wants to run and develop a Raspberry Jam.

Jams are an expression of the Raspberry Pi community's support for the goals
of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Jams help the people who attend to explore the
world of digital making through the sharing of ideas, knowledge, expertise, and
enthusiasm. As a Jam organiser, you are at the forefront of this quest to bring
people together. In return, you can expect an immense amount of satisfaction
from witnessing wonderful moments: when a child first turns on an LED and
gasps; when an adult manages to explain something for the first time without
using technical jargon; when that first solder joint looks perfect; when the first
robot moves; and, most importantly, when anyone realises that they are not
alone. You can also expect to be very busy, both in the lead-up to the event and
on the day itself!

Our Jam in Cambridge started small, with just 30 people in one room. It has now
grown to roughly 150-200 people per event. It has taken a lot of hard work and
dedication to get it to this size. We have developed our Jam into other events: Pi
Wars, a robotics competition, which this year took place over two days; and Potton
Pi and Pints, which is a much smaller event held upstairs in a pub. All of these
models work, as do many others. There are Jams taking place at work venues,
universities, libraries, hackerspaces, conference centres, and even museums.

Each Jam has a different flavour, each Jam attracts a different group of people,
and each Jam has a different buzz about it. As a Jam organiser, all you need
now is enthusiasm and a desire to ask those vital questions: where will I hold my
Raspberry Jam, and what will it look like?

## Introduction

This guide is provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to help members of the
community to set up and run Raspberry Jam events. Raspberry Jam events are
organised and owned by the community. They can be started by anyone who is
enthusiastic about digital making with Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi Foundation
supports and promotes events, but they are fully owned by the organisers. We
recommend that Raspberry Jam organisers follow these guidelines, which have been
gathered from community members running events in the UK. If you are running
a Jam in another country then it is your responsibility to research and follow the
legislation that governs your region.

Contact the Community Manager at jam@raspberrypi.org to provide feedback, or to
ask for further support.

### What is a Raspberry Jam?

Raspberry Jams are independently organised community events where people
get together to share knowledge, learn new things, and meet other Raspberry Pi
enthusiasts. Attending a Jam is a great way to find out more about the Raspberry Pi,
learn what you can do with it, and meet like-minded people. Raspberry Jams provide
opportunities for people to get involved in digital making with Raspberry Pi, develop
their abilities, get together, have fun, and socialise. They are usually free or very cheap
to attend.

There is no one way to run a Raspberry Jam. Every Jam is different. Choose a format
that works for you, and change it over time as the event develops. Some Raspberry
Jams are more structured, with talks and workshops. Others simply provide a space
for people to meet up and talk. Your Jam could be a meetup in a pub, or a large
gathering with a PC suite, workshops, practical activities, and a lecture hall!
Jams range in size. Some involve a handful of people, while others cater for hundreds,
with plenty somewhere in between. With smaller events, it is usually easier to focus
on practical activities such as workshops. Larger events tend to be less practical,
featuring talks and show-and-tell sessions.

> have a policy that addressed their special needs in order to make it
> clear that the Jam was for everyone. The policy just ensures that we

If you are thinking of starting a new Raspberry Jam, or of helping to run an existing event, take
a look at the information in these pages. We have gathered this advice from people who are
already running Raspberry Jams around the UK.

They told us what works best for them and their communities. You can read everything, or jump to
the sections that are most relevant to you.

Jams range in size. Some involve a handful of people, while others cater for

**Raspberry Jams really do take place all over the world! We'd love to help you set up yours.**

### About the Raspberry Pi Foundation

The Raspberry Pi Foundation (UK registered charity 1129409) is based in Cambridge, UK, and works to put the
power of digital making into the hands of people all over the world. We provide outreach, education, learning resources,
and educator training to make programming, digital making, and creative technology accessible for everyone. We
created the Raspberry Pi computer as a low-cost, high performance device that people can use to learn, solve
problems, and have fun.

### Why do you run a Raspberry Jam?

> If someone decided to run a Raspberry Jam I'd ask them why. It
> can be a lot of work, but if you know why you're doing it, suddenly
> all those problems become easier.
>
> **Alan O'Donohoe** - Preston Raspberry Jam

> I got involved by being interested in technology, which then grew
> into a love for Raspberry Pi. I found there wasn't enough of a
> Raspberry Pi community within my area of Scotland so I wanted
> to do something about it.
>
> **Kerry Kidd** - Dundee Raspberry Jam

> I got one of the first Raspberry Pis and was looking to find other
> people like me who had little experience of programming and Linux
> to help and support each other. I approached the library to see if
> they would give us the space and they agreed.
>
> **Simon Belshaw** - Exeter Raspberry Jam

> I went to Picademy, and that gave me the confidence in using the
> technology to organise my first Jam.
>
> **Katharine Childs** - Nottingham Raspberry Jam

> After having such a great time at CamJam and other events,
> I decided to start my own in Birmingham.
>
> **Spencer Organ** - Birmingham Learning Hub

> It's about creating a space for people to meet and learn things.
>
> **Michael Rimicans** - Huddersfield Raspberry Jam

> I want to be able to give something back to the community. I am
> passionate about teaching kids to program and interface with the
> physical world.
>
> **Steve Amor** - Cornwall Tech Jam

> I wanted to keep up to date for the children in the Code Club I run.
> I learn so much, and I always come back inspired with new ideas
> for Code Club.
>
> **Anne Carlill** - York Raspberry Jam

> I've made some great friendships because of the Jams. Continuing
> to organise them means I get to continue with, and to build on,
> those friendships.
>
> **Michael Horne** - CamJam

> I believe that the digital sector offers the people of Cornwall a
> real chance to have rewarding and well-paid careers. We need a
> few more things in place to really make it happen, a more skilled
> workforce being one of them. Hosting a Jam gives people of all
> ages a chance to have a go, ask an expert, and ignite their interest
> in creating tech.
>
> **Mike Trebilcock** - Cornwall Tech Jam

> I love to learn. By bringing makers and others together, I get to see
> a variety of things and discuss amazing ideas. It's great to see eight
> year olds and eighty year olds making lights blink and dinosaurs nod.
>
> **Lucy Rogers** - Blackgang Chine

> I like to give something back to the community, and working
> with the kids who come to the Jam is a rewarding challenge
> that keeps my skills sharp.

> **Les Pounder** - Blackpool Raspberry Jam

> I am passionate about helping children to gain access and insight
> into this essential area of education.
