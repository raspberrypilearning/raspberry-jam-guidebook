CHAPTER ONE: GETTING STARTED

BUILDING YOUR TEAM
Running a Raspberry Jam does not have to be a one-person operation. If you are
working on this alone, try to find some helpers. Look for other people interested in
running a Jam, and involve them in planning the event. Ask around for volunteers to
help on the day, or to help set up the venue before the event. People will be willing
to help: they just need an invitation. Find jobs for your helpers, ask them for their
advice to help you make decisions, and involve them in coordinating the event.
Running a Raspberry Jam does not have to be
a one-person operation.

To find adults who are good at Raspberry Pi, we started looking at Linux
groups, techy companies, and developer meetups. We've run coding
evenings for teachers and Code Club volunteers, who obviously already
have experience with this. Ham radio groups are usually interested, and
have good skills too. We also get all the children to bring their parents:
some of the parents are quite techy, and willing to help.

Finding a venue
Finding a venue is an important step in the
planning of your Jam. If you are just getting
started, you don't need to find a permanent
venue. At this point, your aim is to run your first
event. If you need a bigger venue in the future,
you can look for one then. Many Jams begin with
a small number of people, and grow into a larger
event later. You should choose a venue that is
easy to reach by public transport. Ideally, your
venue will also be accessible to people who use
mobility aids.
When you are looking for a venue, consider the
following options in your area:
libraries
makerspaces
schools, universities, and
colleges

Eventbrite:
eventbrite.com
Meetup:
meetup.com

Try to find out where other groups in your area
meet up. Use websites such as Eventbrite and
Meetup to locate suitable venues.

Try to find a venue that will be free of charge to use. Some Jams do have to pay for
their venues, but this requires fundraising and can be hard to sustain. If the venue
usually charges for bookings, they may allow you to hold your Jam free of charge
if you explain that it is a community meeting, rather than a commercial event.
Alternatively, you could offer to donate all proceeds from the Jam to the venue to
help cover their costs. Charge a small amount for tickets, or ask for donations on the
day. You can find more information on issuing tickets in Chapter Two.

Universities make good venues. They have a lot of different buildings, a
lot of different spaces, and you may find that you can use the different
spaces in unique ways.

I got one of the first Raspberry Pis
and was looking to find other people
like me who had little experience of
programming and Linux to help and
support each other. I approached the
library to see if they would give us the
space and they agreed.
Simon Belshaw - Exeter
Raspberry Jam

Our local library gave us
a venue free of charge:
they're just pleased that
someone is using the
space.
Cat Lamin Wimbledon Raspberry
Jam

I heard about coding coming into schools and that was really the start
of it. At the time, I was asked to run an event to encourage more men
and boys into the library. This ended up being a great event for people
of all ages: the public seem to love the event!
Jacqui Thompson - Gateshead Library

Naming your Jam
Choosing a name for your Jam is an important part of your planning process. It
is best to include your location in the name, but think carefully about the area
you serve or represent. Don't be too broad. For example, calling yourself ‘London
Raspberry Jam' would make it look as if you are the only Raspberry Jam in
London. Be consistent in the use of your Jam name. If you are the Sunnydale
Jam, stick to ‘Sunnydale Jam'. Don't be tempted to refer to yourselves as the
‘Santa Barbara County Jam' or the ‘California Jam' for different events.
You don't have to use the word ‘Jam'. If your event is a different style of meetup,
another name might be more appropriate. An adult-focused tech meetup could
be called ‘[Location] Raspberry Pi User Group', or a pub meetup could be called
‘[Location] Raspberry Pint'. Don't let a different name stop you from engaging
with the Jam community. All Raspberry Pi community events can learn from
each other, and all are welcome on the Jam map.
At this point it might be a good idea to set up an email address for your
Jam. You can use this to answer queries from attendees and to set up
accounts with Eventbrite and social media platforms later.

Support
Remember: when you are organising a Jam, you are not
alone. There are many other people in the Raspberry Pi
community with experience of running events. Reach
out to them to ask for help, to share your ideas, and to
ask for advice.
There are two online communities you can join to network
with other Jam organisers. Slack is a fast-paced instant
chat platform, with chat channels, direct messages, and
groups. Google+ is a slower-paced platform with a single
stream of longer-form posts. Both communities are private
and require membership to be granted. Send an email to
jam@raspberrypi.org to request invitations to join.
It can be very helpful to meet other Jam organisers,
especially when you are getting started. Take a look at the
Jam map at rpf.io/jam and find another Jam to attend.
Contact the Jam organiser and explain that you are
planning to start your own Jam. Give yourself a chance to
ask questions and share your ideas with them. Don't fixate
on trying to match exactly what the other Jam does: do
what you think is suitable and manageable for you and
your Jam.
Make an effort to find out what else is going on in your
area. Are there any local Code Clubs? Is there a CoderDojo
or similar organisation? Is there a hackerspace, or a tech
community space? Are there tech user groups? Reach out
to the people behind these events. Can you work together
to promote your Jam? Can you make use of each other's
resources or experience? If you're in the UK, contact the
Code Club regional coordinator in your area and let them
know what you are planning. Code Club is a programme
run by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, so they will definitely
be interested in hearing about your event.

You'll find that a lot of the people who attend your first Jam will
become your future volunteers.

I really enjoy the challenge, I meet great people, and the maker
crowd are fantastic and really supportive. I also enjoy networking with
people and local companies. It is great for the library, and for my own
skills development.
Jacqui Thompson - Gateshead Library

It can be very helpful to meet other Jam organisers,
especially when you are getting started.

Lead times
People who run big Jams usually give themselves a couple of months to plan
everything, as there's a lot to organise when you're arranging talks, workshops,
and volunteers. Smaller Jams with fewer activities don't take as much planning,
but it's important to give yourself plenty of time for everything to come together,
and to deal with contingencies. Most Jams make their tickets available a month
or so before their event. This gives people the chance to plan their attendance in
advance, and lets the organisers know how many attendees to expect.
11

If you have a regular Jam, it's useful if you are able to keep it to a certain day: you might
decide to hold your Jam on, for example, the first Saturday of each month. That allows
people to plan ahead, and ensures they know when to expect the Jam to take place. If
possible, book your regular dates with your venue in advance. Make the dates available
to your attendees, perhaps on your website.

Raspberry Jam
starter kit
Once you have announced your first event, go to
rpf.io/jamkit to request your Raspberry Jam
starter kit from the Foundation. Your kit will
contain flyers, sets of stickers, magazines, printed
worksheets, and more! You'll also receive a pack
of design assets and templates to help you make
your own posters and other resources.

Checklist
Check that you have:
recruited a team of volunteers to help you run
the event
booked a venue and a date for your first event
chosen a name for your Jam
allowed plenty of time to get everything planned
applied for your Raspberry Jam starter kit

Don't be afraid to start small: it
helps you to gauge interest. Try
somewhere out and find out what
shape your Jam will eventually be.

If you want your Jam to
be child friendly, involve
a local school or teacher
in the planning stage.

CHAPTER TWO: THE NEXT STEPS

Planning your activities
The activities you provide will set the tone for your Jam. Do you want to put on
workshops, arrange talks, or invite people to showcase their personal projects?
Before you start planning your activities, think about what would be suitable for
your event. If you are new to running Jams, it might be best to start with simple
activities, and introduce a more complicated programme for later events. Don't feel
that you have to provide workshops and talks because you've seen them at other
Jams. Do what works for you to get your Jam up and running. You can find more
information on Raspberry Jam activities in Chapter Three.

REMEMBER: you don't have to be the person who does everything and runs
everything at the Jam. Put together a team of people willing to lead sessions and
support your participants with their projects. The skills of the people you recruit will
help to shape the programme for your event.

We tend to visit other Jams to see what inspires us, we then approach
that person to come and run the same workshop at our Jam. As time
goes on, we will try to focus on more children giving the workshops.
Marcus Tyler-Moor - Horsham Raspberry Jam

Ticketing
It is a good idea to set up a ticketing system for attendees. This allows you to keep
track of the number of people planning to attend, keep in contact with them before
and after the event, and manage attendance on the day. Most Jams use Eventbrite
for their ticketing: take a look at the Eventbrite pages of the events on the Raspberry
Jam map. Eventbrite can be used for ticketing a free event, but it also allows you to
sell tickets. It is easy to set up an event page and start publicising your jam.
Start by creating an email account for your Jam, if you haven't done this already. Use
this to create an Eventbrite account for your Jam. Create an event; provide the date,
time, location and other information; and create some tickets. You could provide adult
tickets and child tickets, or morning and afternoon tickets. Eventbrite allows attendees
to choose between registering for a free ticket, or paying a small donation to the Jam.
Your Eventbrite page could function as the home page for your first event.
15

Ticketing your Jam
with Eventbrite
1. Set up an Eventbrite account for your Jam
2. Create your event
3. Create tickets
4. Make your event live
5. Share your ticket link online

Ideally your event will be free to attend for everyone, but this is not always possible.
If you have costs to cover, such as venue hire, you will need to find a way to pay
for this. Charging a small amount for tickets is a fair way of covering your costs.
Consider running your first event in a free venue, and moving to another venue later
if necessary. Take any costs you incur into account, consider the number of people
you are expecting, and work out how much you need to charge. Jams in the UK
often charge around £5 for tickets, but you'll know what's right for your region and
your community.
We encourage you to provide free tickets to children, and to cover your costs by
charging for adult tickets. You may also choose to make free tickets available to
students, and to out-of-work adults. If you have costs to cover, finding a way to
balance freebies with paid tickets can be tricky, but free tickets can dramatically
lower the barrier to entry for some groups of people.
Note that Jams with ticket prices of more than a small nominal fee will not be listed
on the Foundation's website. We make an exception for events where these tickets
are optional, and include the purchase of hardware. Free or cheap tickets must also
be available.
As an alternative to charging for tickets, you could ask for donations. This could
take the form of a ‘pay what you want' ticketing system, a donation option on your
Eventbrite page, or a collection at the event.
For further information, see Eventbrite's getting started guide: rpf.io/ebgs

Jams often charge for tickets, but you'll know what's right
for your region and your community.

16

I
PI

We use Eventbrite. It's pretty simple.
We have it set up so that we have two
batches of tickets up at once, for the
next two events. We have our mailing
list, so we let people know when
the tickets go up, as well as sending
information about what we're up to.
We have ‘attendee' tickets, for people
who are going to take part, and
‘parents, guardians, and other', for
people who don't need access to a
Pi. The tickets are all free, and we put
out about 15 percent extra tickets, in
case people don't show up.

We make sure free tickets
are always available for
those who need them.
We issue an ‘optional
donation' ticket with a
suggested donation of
£3 per person, or £5 if
attending a workshop, but
we make it very clear that
it is entirely optional. We
then also go round and
shake a tin about half an
hour before the end.

Promotion
When you have set up your ticketing page, you need to tell people about it. Think
about who you want to attend your event, who might want to come, and how you
can reach them.
The first step is to submit your Jam to the Raspberry Pi website. If it is a Raspberry
Pi-focused event that is free or cheap to attend, it will appear on the Jam map and in
the calendar. Note that it may take the community team a couple of working days to
moderate your submission.

Submit your Jam:
rpf.io/addjam

17

More promotion ideas
Ask the venue to promote your event.
Set up a Twitter account for the Jam and tweet about the
event. Mention @Raspberry_Pi and use the #rjam hashtag.
Ask other nearby Jams to tweet about your Jam, or tell
people on their mailing list about your event.
If you are in the UK, contact your local Code Club regional
coordinator and ask them to promote your Jam to local Code
Clubs.
Contact the organisers of other local tech events and ask
them to spread the word. Look for CoderDojos, hackerspaces,
user groups, and other meetings.
Publicise your event in local newspapers, on community
boards in shops and libraries, on local news websites, and on
local event listing websites.
Tell your local school, college, or university about your event,
and ask them to share the details with their students.
Create a mailing list for your Jam using MailChimp or similar.
Invite people to register for updates about your events.

When promoting your event,
keep it local. A local radio or

dozen international TV slots.
Nobody watching in California

their kids along to our events.

I use Twitter and Facebook.
I've found it useful to get
the message directly to
schools who use Twitter,
so the IT specialist can
pass the message on

I think old-fashioned

Kit
If you are planning to run practical
Raspberry Pi activities at your Jam,
we recommend providing some basic
kit. You don't have to buy any kit to
get started: you can ask attendees
to bring their own kit from home. If
your venue offers PC suites, use the
monitors and ask people to bring their
own Raspberry Pis and peripherals.
Alternatively, contact the organisers of
other Jams and ask to borrow their kit
for your first event.

Essential Raspberry Pi setup:
Raspberry Pi 3
SD card
power supply
monitor
HDMI cable
USB mouse and keyboard

We suggest you provide the listed kit to
each participant in your activity.

20

I
PI

Additional accessories:
pi-topCEED (if monitors are not available at the
venue)
Raspberry Pi case
Activity-specific kit:
Electronics kit e.g. CamJam EduKits or Pi-Stop
Camera Module
HATs: e.g. Sense HAT, Traffic HAT, Explorer HAT

I duplicate plenty of micro SD cards with up-to-date Raspbian
images and all the workshop files on. The trick is to use a USB 3.0
hub and duplicate SD cards ten at a time. If someone's attending
a workshop and they've brought their own SD card, you can
guarantee it will be out of date and won't have the software they
need. We just have a bunch of SD cards ready to go. It's also handy
to have a USB memory stick so people can transfer any files they
make, and take a copy of their work home.

When I ran my first Jam in 2012, you could only buy one Raspberry
Pi at a time, and you had to wait about three months. The Jam was
essentially the 30 people in Manchester who were lucky enough to
buy one on day one! Following that, more people managed to get
hold of a Pi. It wasn't a problem that the Jam had no kit of its own:
people were expected to bring their own. They were happy working
on their own personal projects, and getting help from each other.
Ben Nuttall - Manchester Raspberry Jam

Check that you have:
chosen activities for your Jam
created an event page for your Jam, and
released tickets
promoted the event in your local
community
collected all the kit required for your
activities

CHAPTER THREE: RUNNING YOUR ACTIVITIES

Your Jam could feature a range of activities. Here are a few ideas.

Drop-in
Organisation: arrange tables, chairs, and power
You will need: tables and chairs, extension cables, monitors,
worksheets (optional)
People: helpers on hand
A popular informal Jam activity is a drop-in. Provide people with space to work on
their own projects, or to look online for something to make or learn. This might seem
like something your attendees could do at home, but doing it at the Jam gives them
the instant support of other community members.
Running a drop-in is easy! You will need to provide tables, chairs, and electricity.
If your venue can give you access to a PC suite, participants can bring their own
Raspberry Pis and connect them to the venue's monitors, mice, and keyboards. You
may wish to provide printed worksheets for people who need guidance, or perhaps
point them in the direction of some online resources. You should encourage
collaboration, or even pair people up to work together.

Some Jams provide space for people to work on their own projects

If you're running a freeform drop-in practical session, make sure your attendees
know in advance, so they can bring what they need to work on their projects.

23

I
PI

Show-and-tell
Organisation: call for participation, arrange space requirements
You will need: tables, extension cables, space for each project
People: exhibitors, helpers for setting up
A show-and-tell is a great activity for inspiring people to create their own projects.
Invite people to bring their own projects along, demonstrate them to attendees,
and talk to people about how they work. Demonstrating personal projects is a great
way to show newcomers what the Raspberry Pi can do. Showcasing them gives
a chance for people to ask the owners questions about the builds, and for the
owners to share their experiences. It is a good idea to organise your show-and-tell
in advance. This allows you to create a list of people and projects, and to plan your
space accordingly.
You'll need to announce your show-and-tell, and make it easy for people to
participate. If you are prepared to let anyone exhibit their project, then just a ticket
type on Eventbrite may suffice. If you have limited space, you could ask people to
apply to take part, so you can choose the most appropriate exhibitors. However you
do this, you'll need to be in contact with exhibitors to make sure you know what
space they need, and what other requirements they have (power, a projector, etc.).

Show-and-tell is a great way to show people what can be made with a Pi

Some show-and-tell projects may be particularly engaging. Robots that participants
can control, or games that people can play are always popular, and make for great
Jam entertainment.

24

Workshops
Organisation: call for workshops, liaison with workshop leaders
You will need: Raspberry Pi setups, worksheets and/or presentations,
additional hardware as required
People: workshop leaders and helpers
Workshops provide structured practical experiences for your participants. You will
need to provide equipment, or ask participants to provide their own. Your workshop
will need a leader. This could be you, or another organiser or helper. The workshop
leader will need to plan their content carefully, and decide how they intend to deliver
it. You could structure it around worksheets, a presentation, or both. Schedule your
workshops with clear start and finish times.

Ben Nuttall leading a workshop at the Manchester Raspberry Jam

Make sure you publicise the level of your workshop. If it is covering an entrylevel subject, make sure that your participants are aware that they don't need
to know anything about the subject to take part. If your workshop is covering a
more advanced subject, make sure that your participants understand what prior
knowledge they will need before they sign up.
You may wish to create your own workshop materials. If you are looking for sample
activities, we've provided a selection of short worksheets for you to use, and modify

25

I
PI
for your own purposes. You can find plenty more inspiration for workshop activities on
the Raspberry Pi website.
If you're creating your own worksheets, be sure to keep the steps easy to follow, and
don't assume any prior knowledge for beginner activities.

Raspberry Jam short worksheets:
We have provided three short two-page worksheets, ideal for giving beginners a
simple exercise to try at your Jam. They all work out of the box in Raspbian with
no additional software requirements. Modding Minecraft with Python requires
no additional hardware. Make random sparkles with the Sense HAT can be used
with the web- or desktop-based emulators if you don't have a physical Sense HAT.
Controlling a traffic light sequence with GPIO Zero requires a Pi-Stop traffic light
board. It can also be used with LEDs on a breadboard.

Raspberry Jam worksheets:
rpf.io/jamws
Raspberry Pi resources:
rpf.io/learn
Raspberry Jam worksheet PDFs:
rpf.io/jamwspdf

REMEMBER: be sure to prepare your SD cards in advance with all the software you need
for the workshop. Note the software requirements for the Raspberry Pi workshops and
the Jam worksheets, and check any requirements with the workshop leaders. It is worth
double-checking the SD cards to make sure they work as expected before the workshop.
26

Talks
Organisation: call for speakers, liaison with speakers
You will need: projector and screen or wall, microphone and
speaker system
People: speakers, volunteer room manager
Another formal activity to consider is a series of talks. These can be lengthy
conference-style presentations, or on-the-spot lightning talks. Scheduled talks give
attendees the chance to share something with the community: a project they've
been working on, something they've learned, or an inspirational story.
If you are planning to run talks, you will need a space that is separate from the rest
of your event so that the talk does not disrupt the other activities, and vice versa.
You will need to provide a projector and a microphone. Ensure that each presenter
is provided with the correct cables to connect their kit to the projector, and with
anything else they need.
Talks don't have to be very long: a series of short ‘lightning talks' can be a great way
to allow people to present their projects, or something they've learned and want to
share. Talks of five, ten, or 15 minutes are a great way to give new speakers (perhaps
young people) the chance to stand up and present on their chosen topic, without
the need to prepare a long lecture.

If you can, try to provide a microphone for your speaker

27

It's all down to what your intentions are for the Jam, what space
you have in your venue, and what equipment you have available.
For instance, for your first Jam, you may not have any kit and
you may have a small venue, which dictates a mix of talks and/or
show-and-tell. In larger venues, you potentially have more rooms
to use, so you can expand into workshops (provided you can gather
enough equipment together), more show-and-tell, and even a
marketplace if you can persuade vendors to attend.
Michael Horne - Cambridge Raspberry Jam

When I ran the Manchester Jam, people were happy to work on
their own projects. Occasionally we ran a track of talks, or put on
a workshop, which was a nice change. Now I run the Jam at Pi
Towers, the attendees tended to be mostly beginners – usually
parents with their children – so we mostly run workshops and hand
out worksheets.

More activity ideas
This is not an exhaustive list of the things that take place at Jams. For more
ideas, talk to other Jam organisers.
Some Jams invite retailers to sell Raspberry Pi accessories at the Jam. This
can be an effective way for retailers to reach customers in the Raspberry
Pi community. It is the perfect place for attendees to look at kit before they
buy, and to put questions to the sellers in person. Make sure that retailers
know you are looking for sellers for your Jam. Approach retailers directly,
particularly local sellers. Look for contact information on retailers' websites,
or reach out on Twitter.
Use beginner sessions to introduce newcomers to the Raspberry Pi for the
first time. Some Jams run Q&A sessions for people new to the device. Others
provide volunteers ready to work with people who turn up with a Raspberry
Pi they haven't used yet, and help them get started.
Bigger Jams holding formal talks will sometimes host a panel session, giving
the audience a chance to ask a group of experienced individuals questions
on a particular topic.
A TeachMeet is an event where teachers gather to give short presentations
to their peers and share ideas for teaching. Why not run a Raspberry Pifocused TeachMeet, with practical workshops and short presentations?
More information on organising a TeachMeet can be found on the Teacher
Toolkit website.
Your Jam could promote participation in other Raspberry Pi programmes and
competitions. Pioneers is aimed at teams of 12- to 15-year-olds, and Astro
Pi is aimed at under-16s and their teachers. You can find information and
resources for these programmes on the Raspberry Pi website.
Try using the Code Club material for beginners. Just register your Jam as a
Code Club. First, register yourself as a host on the Code Club website. Find
a volunteer willing to support nine- to eleven-year-olds to work on projects
in Scratch, HTML, and Python. Register them as an official volunteer on the
website, and your Code Club will be activated.

When a competition like Astro Pi, or
a programme like Pioneers comes
out, we'll do talks, and invite people
along to take part in workshops at
the Jam. It's good because it gives
an incentive for people to come
along and take part, and gives them
motivation to work. We celebrate
the entrants, and those who've
won, and invite them to do talks.
We ask them to mentor at future
Raspberry Jams, or run workshops.

Something like Astro
Pi is a fantastic thing
to get involved in if
you want to really give
children some focus

CHAPTER FOUR: RUNNING A SAFE JAM

It's important that the event you run is safe to attend for everyone,
paying particular attention to the needs of people under 18 and
vulnerable adults. It is your responsibility as event organiser to
make sure you are familiar with the legislation governing your
region and that you adhere to it in all respects.

Start every event by explaining where the fire exits are, and where
people should assemble in the event of a fire alarm. Talk to your
volunteers and discuss how you would help a wheelchair user
evacuate. Usually the plan is that someone stays with them to help
them evacuate last, so they get a clear path and other people don't
trip over them. Some buildings have a wheelchair refuge area with a
communication panel: make sure you know where it is.
Andrew Oakley - Cotswold Jam

It's handy to point out the fire exits, toilets, catering, and the like while
you're welcoming people. If you're not doing an opening talk, then ask
your check-in volunteers to point these out as people walk in.

Risk assessment

I
PI

Your venue may ask you to complete a risk assessment. Some venues may provide
examples and templates to help you with this task. If you are planning activities that
involve increased risk to participants, such as soldering, you will need to think about
safety precautions. You should plan to provide warnings, explain the dangers, and
give sufficient training to anyone wishing to take part.
Be aware that your participants may bring their own projects. Use your risk
assessment to develop a plan for checking their equipment and ensuring that their
activities are safe.

33

Unless required by your venue, your risk assessment does not need to be a formal
document. Aim to put together a common-sense approach to assessing situations,
ensuring that your activities are not putting people in danger, and making sensible
decisions to minimise risk.
For more information, see the Resource Centre website. This provides plenty of
resources to help with compiling risk assessments, including templates and advice.

Resource Centre:
rpf.io/ra

REMEMBER: “Risk assessment is about achieving a balance between a reasonable
level of risk, and being able to get on with organising your activities. Remember,
no activity is completely free from risk, and doing a risk assessment is not about
making your activities risk-free.”
- Resource Centre

Our venue, a university, required us to perform a risk assessment
and have public liability insurance. I had experience with risk
assessments from work, so that was straightforward, but anyone
who doesn't have that experience can find plenty of examples
online. Alternatively, ask someone at your venue to help you fill it
out: it should only take twenty minutes. You just need to think of
the top ten ‘what ifs' and give sensible solutions. We bought public
liability insurance through events-insurance.co.uk. Remember to
buy it only for the days of your events, not all year round!

of soldering, we needed a
bucket of water for burns
and a first aider on hand, just
in case.

I hold a monthly Jam at
the Raspberry Pi offices in
Cambridge, where we have a
perfectly suitable space to run
a Jam. I discussed it with our
office manager and operations
director, who helped me
calculate the maximum capacity
of the space, and go over any
precautions or risks we should
consider. They were really
helpful and made it so much
easier to plan my first event.

Safeguarding
Raspberry Jams should be creative, fun, and safe places for adults and children to
learn, and to meet other makers. As the event organiser, you should take reasonable
precautions to ensure that all attendees and staff are kept safe. You should ensure
that children attending your event are not left unsupervised, and that parents stay
with their children.

Any adults at your event must:
never be left alone with young people or
vulnerable adults
take care not to have physical contact with young
people or vulnerable adults attending the event
not take or share photos of others without
appropriate permission

Your venue may have a safeguarding policy. Ask to see it, and follow any guidelines
it provides.
35

Although most of our volunteers are DBS-cleared through other
voluntary work, we made a conscious decision that we wanted
parents to remain with their children. The responsible adult does
not need their own ticket, but requiring parents or guardians to
accompany their children removes the need for DBS paperwork,
and means that every child has a familiar authority figure on hand.
We also find that children are more focused in the workshops when
their parents are around.
Andrew Oakley - Cotwold Jam

Checklist
Check that you have:
considered any potential risks
involved in running your activities
taken precautions to minimise any
potential risks
completed a risk assessment, if
required
ensured that all staff are briefed on
safeguarding guidelines
ensured all attendees and staff are
protected at all times

CHAPTER FIVE: MONEY

Financial
management
It is your responsibility as the event organiser
to make sure you are familiar with any
regulations governing the management of
funds for community groups in your region, and
that you adhere to them in all respects.
If you find yourself holding funds after your Jam, make
sure you keep a careful record of income and outgoings.
This is particularly important if you are holding funds in a
personal bank account. Use a spreadsheet to identify how
much money belongs to the Jam, and make sure you don't
end up spending your own money. The Resource Centre
website offers advice on taking care of finances for a
community group.
If your Jam ends up generating a lot of revenue, think
about keeping the Jam money separate from your private
accounts. If your Jam is based at a school, university,
library, or community space, you could ask them to hold
the money for you, and make payments and purchases on
your behalf. Alternatively, you could set up a community
bank account. Some banks offer special accounts for small
voluntary and community organisations, which provide free
banking as long as your account is in credit.
Make sure you can easily transfer ownership of the
account, money, and any equipment you own to someone
new if you decide to hand over the running of the event.
Using bank accounts with multiple signatories, and keeping
careful records of the ownership of equipment will help
to make a handover more straightforward. If you cannot
find anyone to take over the running of your Jam, contact
the Community Manager at jam@raspberrypi.org for
guidance. We suggest that you pass on any assets to
another Jam in your area.

A bank account is something we have been looking into for a while. We
looked around the major banks and shortlisted it down to two. These
banks both offer free community bank accounts that are basically
business bank accounts, free of charge for not-for-profit community
organisations.
We ended up choosing the bank whose application process could
be completed online. The process involved filling out a long webbased application form, covering everything from the purpose of your
organisation and uploading a formal rules and regulations document,
to your tax status, and so on. For any section we weren't sure about, we
simply gave them a call and queried it. The entire process took about
a month, with the result being a full business bank account with debit
cards and a chequebook, and the option to require everything to be
countersigned. This is certainly a time-consuming process if your Jam
isn't an official organisation, but being able to manage the Jam's money
from a central location is something that will pay off in the long term,
especially if there are ever any questions asked about where donations
and funds have been spent.
Andrew Mulholland - Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam

The venue I used for the Manchester Jam was a community space which
held other tech meetups. Since we used the whole venue for a whole
day, I offered to donate all the ticket money to them, to put towards
their running costs. Any extra donations or sponsorship we got, I put
towards buying pizza at the event, and any surplus I saved, keeping track
of how much we had. When it built up to about £200, I decided to buy
some Raspberry Pis for the Jam. When I moved away from Manchester, I
agreed to hand over the event organisation to one of my volunteers, and
I left him with the remaining balance.
Ben Nuttall - Manchester Raspberry Jam

38

Between the two of us, we looked at our own personal banks to see
what options were available. We decided that, seeing as I do most
of the paperwork, we should go with my bank. They required lots of
forms of identification and other paperwork, as well as a personal
meeting with a banker. It took them a while to sort everything out,
but we're much happier now that the money goes directly into that
account. It helps keep us organised!
Michael Horne - Cambridge Raspberry Jam

Fundraising
If your Jam runs regularly, it provides both an incentive and an opportunity to raise
funds. If you take in more than you need, you can keep the remainder as a float for the
Jam. You can use this to cover future costs, or save it to buy equipment for the Jam.
If you find that your Jam would benefit from buying some equipment, and your leftover
ticket money isn't enough to cover what you need, you might want to consider doing
some fundraising. A simple option is to ask for donations, using a ‘donation' ticket type,
or even having a donation tin at the event. Alternatively, you could run a crowdfunding
campaign to raise awareness of your group's community activities, and ask for
donations to provide more opportunities to local kids.
You could even organise an old-fashioned fundraiser, like a sponsored walk or a
cake sale! If you can get all your members involved, they can help to promote the
community message.

In order to avoid charging for tickets, we always hold a raffle and
raise between £60 and £200, and everyone's happy whether they
win or not. You can use Twitter to ask for swag from the community,
to give away as prizes. It's so nice to be able to run community
events which are free to attend.
Grace Owolade-Coombes - South London Raspberry Jam

I
PI

We hand out free raffle
tickets while we shake the
donation tin. Then we pull
winning tickets from a box
and they win a prize we've
had donated, like a HAT or
something.

We have some SD cards which
we loan out for the afternoon,
and other cards which we sell at a
small profit. If you can find a cheap
source of decent blank SD cards,
then it's a good way to raise funds
while also solving a big problem.

Andrew Oakley Cotswold Jam

Sponsorship
Another approach is to contact companies and organisations to ask for sponsorship
for your event. You may find that local technology companies are willing to sponsor
your event as part of their corporate social responsibility and community outreach
initiatives. Tech firms are likely to want to encourage the teaching of digital skills in
the local area.
The best way to approach a company for sponsorship is to specify an aspect of the
event to be supported by their funds. You can't expect them to cover all your costs,
but if you have something in mind that they can contribute to, this will help. Good
examples include buying pizza for the event, or buying a set of Raspberry Pis for
workshops.
Be grateful for any donations or sponsorship you receive, and be sure to thank the
donors privately and publicly. A “thank you” tweet from your Jam's account will be
well received, and companies will appreciate the publicity. Encourage attendees to
retweet, and to add their own thanks to your message.
As well as local companies, you could approach Raspberry Pi retailers to ask whether
they would sponsor an event. If you can give them space to promote or sell their
products, they may find sponsorship to be a very worthwhile gesture. Note that if you
are planning to allow companies to sell products at the event, you should check this
with your venue first.
If you ask a company for sponsorship and they say no, be polite and move on. You
may approach a company that has sponsored other events, and find that they refuse
when you ask. Don't take offence, as this could simply mean that they have spent
their sponsorship budget for the year.
40

Initially, my son Femi ran a highly successful crowdfunding
campaign using Indiegogo, by producing a one-minute film about
what he wanted to do and the equipment he would need. We set
the target at £500 over a two-week period. We got that in four days,
and went on to raise £1,270 which has lasted us for 18 months.
We went to all the Jams we could, and Femi did talks at places like
CamJam and PyCon. We've had donations of kit from Raspberry Pi
retailers.
It's really important not to overdo the amount you aim to collect.
The key thing is to meet people in person, build up a relationship,
and always send thanks via Twitter and blog posts. You really
shouldn't automatically expect companies to donate supplies to
you, but be really grateful when they do.

CHAPTER SIX: PLANNING THE BIG DAY

Volunteers
To run your event, you are going to need as many volunteers and helpers as you
can find. Ask existing members of the Raspberry Pi community to help you run
the event. You could also look for helpers in the wider digital making community:
Code Clubs, CoderDojos, hackerspaces, and other tech groups.
Helpers are important. Workshop leaders will appreciate a second pair of hands,
speakers will need someone to introduce them and manage timings, beginner
sessions need people to guide newcomers. If you are checking people into the
event, you will need volunteers helping on the door. The more volunteers you
have, the easier everything will be, and the less each person will have to do.
It is good practice to waive the ticket fee for helpers. Make sure your helpers know
what their roles are, and that they are happy with their tasks. Make sure your
helpers feel appreciated and valued, and that they are able to enjoy the event as
well as taking part. Name badges are useful for both the helpers and attendees,
and will help your volunteers to feel part of your team. Make it obvious who the
helpers are, and make sure attendees know who they can go to for help.

Our volunteers have badges that say
‘Jam Maker' on them. Sometimes we
have lanyards. Tim and I tend to wear
our purple CamJam polo shirts. They
weren't cheap, but we do stand out!
Michael Horne - Cambridge
Raspberry Jam

43

I
PI

Help volunteers to stand out with crew t-shirts

The more volunteers you have, the easier everything will be.

Schedule
If your Jam features scheduled activities, draw up a timetable for the day. If you can,
share it with attendees before the event. Display your schedule in the venue on the
day, on screens or posters, to help people to plan their activities.

Checking in
If you want to check your attendees into the event, print out a list from your
Eventbrite page, and ask a volunteer to tick people off as they arrive. You can also
check people in on a laptop using the Eventbrite website, or on a tablet or phone
using the Eventbrite app. Give out name badges to attendees (a sticky label will do).
This will make them feel more welcome, and encourage them to socialise with other
people at the Jam.
If you are taking photos for social media, ask your attendees (especially parents) at
check-in for their permission to use photos online. If anyone refuses permission, let
your photographers know. Giving these people a name badge in a different colour will
help the photographers to spot people who don't want to be in photos, both at the
event, and when they are reviewing their images later.
44

We have a main check-in desk by
the front door. As folks come in,
they are checked off the Eventbrite
list by someone searching for
names on one of the laptops, or by
scanning their ticket via the mobile
app. As well as the main Eventbrite
attendee list, we also maintain a
separate list as people arrive, so
that we know who is in the building
in case of a fire.

We use the Eventbrite
app to check in attendees
where possible. However,
people tend to arrive all at
once and we don't like a
queue. If it's not possible
to scan the tickets, we just
check them as they come
in. It means our numbers
are a little off, but it keeps
people happier.

Andrew Mulholland Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam

Michael Horne Cambridge Raspberry
Jam

Catering
Some Jams use part of the ticket price to provide catering. Others collect donations
and order pizza on the day. If your venue has a café, make sure it is open and
accessible to your attendees. Water, tea, coffee, juice, and biscuits will keep most
people happy during the event.
Whether or not you provide catering, your attendees will need access to food and
drink. Provide information on nearby shops and cafés and set up a re-entry system
to allow people to go out for refreshments. If your venue is on a high street, or
close to plenty of shops and cafés, it might be easier to ask people to source their
own food.
If you are providing food, make sure you have an allergy policy. You can't assume that
everyone can eat what you provide, and it might not be obvious whether allergens
are present. This uncertainty could mean that some attendees are unable to eat, or it
could lead to a serious allergic reaction. Ask people to provide details of their allergies
and other dietary requirements in advance, and think about how you are going to
cater for them.

45

Providing a variety of pizza for all your attendees

We searched online for caterers in a 30-mile radius of the CamJam
venue, and managed to find someone who would attend the event
free of charge. For Pi Wars, at the Cambridge Computer Lab, we
are obliged to use their internal catering which costs us £200 per
day to cover staffing costs. It's very convenient, for us and the
attendees, and we know we can build that into the ticket price.
Michael Horne - Cambridge Raspberry Jam

We're not allowed food and drink inside our venue. The event starts
at 1pm so we advise people to eat before they arrive, and we point
out some local cafés.
Andrew Oakley - Cotswold Jam

46

I took inspiration from other tech events I attended, and simply
ordered pizza on the day of the event. Using money collected
from donations and sponsorship, I would order as many pizzas as I
thought we'd need, ensuring we had veggie options, and I'd tweet
the order progress URL so people could follow along. While we
waited for the pizza, I'd ask a volunteer to nip to the shop to buy a
few large bottles of soft drink.

CHAPTER SEVEN: AFTER THE FIRST JAM

Reflection
Was it a good event?
What did people like about it?
Would you do it again?
If you were to run another
event, what would you do
differently?
How often will you run the
Jam in the future?

One of our key things is that
they're not there to learn code,
or learn electronics. They're
there to have fun, and they
might learn a bit about code
and electronics. But we're doing
projects they want to make,
they want to shout about, they
want to tweet about, and show
all their friends about.

You might be ready to start
planning your next event
straight away. That's great! If
you can use the same venue
again, choose another date,
set up an Eventbrite page,
and start promoting the Jam.
If running the first event was
an overwhelming experience,
take a break and don't rush
into the next event. Think
about what you would do
differently. Organise more
support for your next event.
For help with your next
steps, reach out to members
of the Raspberry Jam
community, and contact
the Community Manager at
jam@raspberrypi.org.

When I ran my first Jam, I thought
of it as being a meetup for techie
adults, but I decided to run the first
one on a Saturday. When kids and
families turned up, I realised this was
a better format than I had had in
mind. It was great to see people of all
ages enthused by technology, so we
kept the free-form practical format,
and it worked really well.
Ben Nuttall - Manchester
Raspberry Jam

I know I'll need some
good ideas to move
beginners on, or they
won't return. I know I
will have to advertise
more widely to get
the same number of
people next time. People
always come in greater
numbers to the first of
something new.
Anne Carlill - York
Raspberry Jam

To begin with, we aimed at introducing coding and physical
computing to young people, parents, and teachers through Raspberry
Pi. Now we are developing the digital making skills of our regular
young coders through collaboration on projects like Pioneers,
entering competitions like Astro Pi, and developing young leaders
who are going to be teaching others. We want to link up with other
young leaders in other parts of the country too. We are even planning
a road trip to Bangladesh to share experiences with other young
people. It's all very exciting!
Grace Owolade-Coombes - South London Raspberry Jam

Social media
Setting up social media accounts for your Jam will enable you to keep in touch
with your attendees, and publicise your future events.
Twitter is probably the most effective medium for keeping your followers up to
date. Bear in mind that different types of events might be suited to different
social media sites. Consider using Facebook, Google+, or Meetup as well as
Twitter. Try out different platforms, but don't create extra work for yourself. If a
50

social media site is unlikely to work for you, or you can't be sure that you can spare
the time to look after it, don't use it.
Follow other Jams and members of the Pi community on Twitter and other networks.
Retweet and share relevant content created by community members, particularly those
in your area. Share successful events, ask for help, and provide help to others when you
can. Social media can be a great tool for bringing people together to solve problems.
Make sure that you set up dedicated accounts for your Jam don't use your own
personal accounts, and don't use the Jam account as your personal account.
Keep the content of your social media relevant to the Jam, and suitable for all
ages. Make sure that any accounts you set up can be used by others on your Jam
organisation team, and transferred to someone else if you decide to hand over the
running of the event.

When I started the Jam, I just used Eventbrite. After a few events, I set up
a WordPress site and a Twitter account. Eventually I registered a domain
name and moved the site from wordpress.com to the server hosting my
personal blog, so it didn't cost me anything to run. I would update the
website with event information for newcomers, and regularly blogged
links to interesting Pi projects from members of our local community.
You don't have to have all these things to begin with, but it makes sense
to build up your web and social media presence over time as your Jam
grows. Starting with a Twitter account is an easy way to put the word out
without making lots of work for yourself.
Ben Nuttall - Manchester Raspberry Jam

After running my first few Jams at the Raspberry Pi offices, I was
struggling for volunteers for my next event. I reached out to Mike, who
runs the big Cambridge Jam, to ask if any of his volunteers could help
out. Within an hour I had over ten offers of help, thanks to a quick email
he sent round. It's great to have the support of other Jam teams.

PI

Start a mailing list
Now that you've established your Jam, you should
aim to maintain contact with people who attended,
and set up a mailing list so that new people can
register for updates, and hear when you announce
future events.

The community is so
supportive and it is
nice to be part of that.
Scott Turner Northamptonshire
Raspberry Jam

Having a staff mailing list for all your active volunteers really helps:
mailmanlists.net run email discussion lists, and they give free accounts
to worthy causes like Raspberry Jams.
Andrew Oakley - Cotswold Jam

Create a website
Once your Jam is established, you could create a website to give you a
permanent presence online. This is not essential, but it can be useful for people
to search for your Jam and find a permanent home page. Your website could
link to your Eventbrite listings, and your social media channels. You could even
maintain a blog about your activities.
You don't need to spend ages designing and developing a website from scratch.
Start with something simple like wordpress.com. Setting up your own domain
is not essential, and can come later. If you don't want to rush into creating a
website, you can take a look at other Jams' websites for inspiration.

Create a logo
A logo will give a sense of identity to your Jam. You can use the Raspberry Jam
logo created by our designers at Pi Towers, which has been designed to allow you
to include the name of your Jam if you wish. Alternatively, you can create your
own: many Jam logos are created by members of the community and adapted
for different purposes.
The Raspberry Jam Branding Pack includes the logo, fonts, templates, and usage
guidelines. You can download it from rpf.io/jambrand. Please observe the usage
guidelines, and note that you must not incorporate the Raspberry Pi logo into any
design that you create. The Raspberry Pi logo is trademarked, and reserved for
official Raspberry Pi partners.

Frequency
Having run your first Jam, you may find that you are happy to run an event every
month. This is great news for local digital makers, offering a regular opportunity to
meet new and returning members of your community.
Bigger Jams tend to run less often, as they take a lot more time and effort to run.
Look at your options and decide what makes sense for you.

Feedback
It is important to keep your Jam focused
on the people who attend, while being
welcoming to newcomers. Put together
a survey after your first event. Ask people
what they expect from the Jam. Do they
need practical help? Would they prefer
workshops, beginner sessions, or talks?
Ask them which workshops, talks, or other
activities they enjoyed. Use Google Forms
or SurveyMonkey to create and distribute
surveys quickly and easily.

Google Forms

SurveyMonkey

Raspberry Jam network
Use the Raspberry Jam Google+ and Slack communities to stay connected with
other Jam organisers, share experiences, and ask for help. Google+ and Slack
community members are the first to hear about Jam developments from the
Foundation, and your feedback will help to shape the support we provide.
Share your experiences on Twitter and other social media. Help others to get
involved in Jams, and celebrate the successes of your Jam and your participants.
Use the #rjam hashtag in your tweets. Many Jam organisers (and the Foundation
team) monitor this hashtag, and will often retweet or answer calls for help.

54

REMEMBER: Share your experiences on Twitter and other social media.

Just being able to chat on
Slack with people who have
more experience of Jams has
made me more confident in
running one. I think, “If they
can do this, so can I!” Also, I
often read a message that's
for someone else and learn
something useful to me, e.g.
about paying for the room and
equipment, or running a raffle.

Ever since setting up the
Raspberry Jam Slack team,
I've found it to be a great way
for Jam organisers to find and
support each other. Before I've
even had my morning coffee,
someone will have asked
a question, and it will have
several helpful answers. Much
better than everyone waiting for
me to check my email inbox.

CHAPTER EIGHT: DEVELOPING YOUR JAM

Managing growth
When you've run a few events, and word of your Jam has spread, you may find
that your tickets sell out quickly. You may find that you are turning away large
numbers of people who would like to attend. You need to manage this growth while
maintaining the quality of your events. You could consider:

Moving to a
bigger venue
If your venue has a capacity of 30, but you have
100 people who want to attend, you could look for
a venue large enough for 100 people. However, this
means that you will be running a much larger event.
Will you still be able to provide practical activities for
this many people? Would you still be able to run it
every month? Will people still enjoy it?

Running your
event more often
If you are running your Jam every two or three
months, running events more regularly could
both increase your reach and reduce the demand
for tickets.

57

I
PI

Setting up more
events in your area
If your Jam is the only one in your region, helping
someone to set up a second event might take the
pressure off your Jam, and give your attendees
a choice of events to go to. You could work with
helpers and volunteers to set up other Jams in
your region.
There is no single correct way to develop your
Jam. Think about what works for you and your
participants, and look for ways to include more
people in Jam events. Talk to other Jam organisers
about how their events have developed over time.
Ask your attendees what developments they would
like to see, and ask your volunteers what growth
they would be willing to support.

Case study:
development and growth
MANCHESTER RASPBERRY JAM
Manchester Raspberry Jam ran its first event in June 2012, and has run events in most
months since then. It started as a small Jam of about 25 people in a tech community
space in the early days of Raspberry Pi. It was designed for Raspberry Pi users to
come together and learn about what could be done with the Pi, and attendees would
usually work on their own projects. The Jam had no equipment, so attendees were
asked to bring their own monitors, mice, keyboards, and other equipment from home.
Free tickets were released on Eventbrite, and sponsorship money, donated by local
companies and attendees, went towards buying pizza on the day of the event.
Manchester has a thriving tech scene, with plenty of user groups and meetups, so
we spread the word among those groups. The events were attended by a mix of tech
professionals of all ages, as well as parents, kids, and teachers. Parents would work on
projects with their children, and keen teachers would come along to learn about coding
and making from other Raspberry Pi users.
Over time, the Jam grew, and it soon extended into the upstairs part of the venue. We
filled all the available space, which doubled the capacity of the event. At its fullest, close
to 100 people attended the Jam. Eventually, the Jam found a new venue with more
space at the university, allowing the organisers to open the event up to a larger number
of people, and provide space for workshops as well as freeform hacking. Over time, the
Jam has collected money from ticket sales and sponsorship, which has allowed them
to purchase their own equipment. Jam equipment, as well as donated hardware, allows
them provide Raspberry Pi setups at Jam events for people who don't have their own.

Case study: developing diversity
SOUTH LONDON RASPBERRY JAM
One of the big things that has come up for us so far is looking at access, diversity, and
equality in terms of delivering events and workshops. When we've run our big events,
we've really been successful in introducing coding to a wide group of people. We've
done a lot of outreach work as well. We've made partnerships with Tourettes Action
and Autism organisations, so they advertise what we're doing in their networks. We've
been been providing Autism and Tourettes sponsored tickets on Eventbrite, because
the parents of those kids tend to be more cautious. Because our tickets go really
quickly, we make sure some of these tickets are set aside so parents can take their time
deciding whether they want to come.
We've been working in local communities, talking to kids who've been excluded. We talk
about what we're doing and ask the parents if they want to come along along. Many
people don't think that this is for them, but that personal invitation helps us to build a
relationship with them.
There are great parent-child pairs that work together in our Jams. We're starting with
Astro Pi and Pioneers, and the parents have been fantastic. It's been a really good
experience for everyone, as the parent is able to give the child one-to-one attention.
You can't drop your kids off and go shopping, and expect your kid to have the same
experience as another child who's got a parent with them.
Some parents think this isn't for them, because they feel they're not techy enough, but
this can be a great learning opportunity for them, too. Touching base with people like
that on an individual basis is important: when they do come, they tend to enjoy it. We
even give some of the older kids the opportunity to run workshops for the parents.
