## Introduction

This guide is provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to help members of the community to set up and run Raspberry Jam events. Raspberry Jam events are organised and owned by the community. They can be started by anyone who is enthusiastic about digital making with Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi Foundation supports and promotes events, but they are fully owned by the organisers. We recommend that Raspberry Jam organisers follow these guidelines, which have been gathered from community members running events in the UK. If you are running a Jam in another country then it is your responsibility to research and follow the legislation that governs your region.

Contact the Community Manager at jam@raspberrypi.org to provide feedback, or to ask for further support.

### What is a Raspberry Jam?

Raspberry Jams are independently organised community events where people get together to share knowledge, learn new things, and meet other Raspberry Pi enthusiasts. Attending a Jam is a great way to find out more about the Raspberry Pi, learn what you can do with it, and meet like-minded people. Raspberry Jams provide opportunities for people to get involved in digital making with Raspberry Pi, develop their abilities, get together, have fun, and socialise. They are usually free or very cheap to attend.

There is no one way to run a Raspberry Jam. Every Jam is different. Choose a format that works for you, and change it over time as the event develops. Some Raspberry Jams are more structured, with talks and workshops. Others simply provide a space for people to meet up and talk. Your Jam could be a meetup in a pub, or a large gathering with a PC suite, workshops, practical activities, and a lecture hall!

Jams range in size. Some involve a handful of people, while others cater for hundreds, with plenty somewhere in between. With smaller events, it is usually easier to focus on practical activities such as workshops. Larger events tend to be less practical, featuring talks and show-and-tell sessions.

*One of the really good things about running a small Jam is that we can spend one-to-one time with each person.*

**Andy Melder** — Southend Raspberry Jam

*The best Jams I've been to are the Jams with people of different ages, and different levels of experience.*

**Alan O'Donohoe** — Preston Raspberry Jam

*It's great to see the passion from the kids in creating cool stuff with Raspberry Pis and code. That lightbulb moment makes all the prep, setup, and pack-down time completely worth it.*

**Andrew Mulholland** — Northern Ireland Raspberry Jam

*We have found that our Jam attracts all types of people, including those with special educational needs. We thought it was useful to have a policy that addressed their special needs in order to make it clear that the Jam was for everyone. The policy just ensures that we do certain things for those with special needs so that the playing field is levelled just that bit more.*

**Michael Horne** — Cambridge Raspberry Jam

*If you are thinking of starting a new Raspberry Jam, or of helping to run an existing event, take a look at the information in these pages. We have gathered this advice from people who are already running Raspberry Jams around the UK.*

*They told us what works best for them and their communities. You can read everything, or jump to the sections that are most relevant to you.*

*Jams range in size. Some involve a handful of people, while others cater for hundreds, with plenty somewhere in between.*

**Raspberry Jams really do take place all over the world! We'd love to help you set up yours.**

### About the Raspberry Pi Foundation

The Raspberry Pi Foundation (UK registered charity 1129409) is based in Cambridge, UK, and works to put the power of digital making into the hands of people all over the world. We provide outreach, education, learning resources, and educator training to make programming, digital making, and creative technology accessible for everyone. We created the Raspberry Pi computer as a low-cost, high performance device that people can use to learn, solve problems, and have fun.

### Why do you run a Raspberry Jam?

*If someone decided to run a Raspberry Jam I'd ask them why. It can be a lot of work, but if you know why you're doing it, suddenly all those problems become easier.*

**Alan O'Donohoe** — Preston Raspberry Jam

*I got involved by being interested in technology, which then grew into a love for Raspberry Pi. I found there wasn't enough of a Raspberry Pi community within my area of Scotland so I wanted to do something about it.*

**Kerry Kidd** — Dundee Raspberry Jam

*I got one of the first Raspberry Pis and was looking to find other people like me who had little experience of programming and Linux to help and support each other. I approached the library to see if they would give us the space and they agreed.*

**Simon Belshaw** — Exeter Raspberry Jam

*I went to Picademy, and that gave me the confidence in using the technology to organise my first Jam.*

**Katharine Childs** — Nottingham Raspberry Jam

*After having such a great time at CamJam and other events, I decided to start my own in Birmingham.*

**Spencer Organ** — Birmingham Learning Hub

*It's about creating a space for people to meet and learn things.*

**Michael Rimicans** — Huddersfield Raspberry Jam

*I want to be able to give something back to the community. I am passionate about teaching kids to program and interface with the physical world.*

**Steve Amor** — Cornwall Tech Jam

*I wanted to keep up-to-date for the children in the Code Club I run. I learn so much, and I always come back inspired with new ideas for Code Club.*

**Anne Carlill** — York Raspberry Jam

*I've made some great friendships because of the Jams. Continuing to organise them means I get to continue with, and to build on, those friendships.*

**Michael Horne** — CamJam

*I believe that the digital sector offers the people of Cornwall a real chance to have rewarding and well-paid careers. We need a few more things in place to really make it happen, a more skilled workforce being one of them. Hosting a Jam gives people of all ages a chance to have a go, ask an expert, and ignite their interest in creating tech.*

**Mike Trebilcock** — Cornwall Tech Jam

*I love to learn. By bringing makers and others together, I get to see a variety of things and discuss amazing ideas. It's great to see eight year olds and eighty year olds making lights blink and dinosaurs nod.*

**Lucy Rogers** — Blackgang Chine

*I like to give something back to the community, and working with the kids who come to the Jam is a rewarding challenge that keeps my skills sharp.*

**Les Pounder** — Blackpool Raspberry Jam

*I am passionate about helping children to gain access and insight into this essential area of education.*

**Bill Harvey** — Barnstaple Raspberry Jam
