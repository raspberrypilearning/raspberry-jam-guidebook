## Chapter Seven: After the first Jam

### Reflection

- Was it a good event?
- What did people like about it?
- Would you do it again?
- If you were to run another event, what would you do differently?
- How often will you run the Jam in the future?

You might be ready to start planning your next eventstraight away. That's great! If you can use the same venue again, choose another date, set up an Eventbrite page, and start promoting the Jam. If running the first event was an overwhelming experience, take a break and don't rush into the next event. Think about what you would do differently. Organise more support for your next event.

For help with your next steps, reach out to members of the Raspberry Jam community, and contact the Community Manager at jam@raspberrypi.org.

*One of our key things is that they're not there to learn code, or learn electronics. They're there to have fun, and they might learn a bit about code and electronics. But we're doing projects they want to make, they want to shout about, they want to tweet about, and show all their friends about.*

*When I ran my first Jam, I thought of it as being a meetup for techie adults, but I decided to run the first one on a Saturday. When kids and families turned up, I realised this was a better format than I had had in mind. It was great to see people of all ages enthused by technology, so we kept the free-form practical format, and it worked really well.*

*I know I'll need some good ideas to move beginners on, or they won't return. I know I will have to advertise more widely to get the same number of people next time. People always come in greater numbers to the first of something new.*

**Anne Carlill** — York Raspberry Jam

*To begin with, we aimed at introducing coding and physical computing to young people, parents, and teachers through Raspberry Pi. Now we are developing the digital making skills of our regular young coders through collaboration on projects like Pioneers, entering competitions like Astro Pi, and developing young leaders who are going to be teaching others. We want to link up with other young leaders in other parts of the country too. We are even planning a road trip to Bangladesh to share experiences with other young people. It's all very exciting!*

### Social media

Setting up social media accounts for your Jam will enable you to keep in touch with your attendees, and publicise your future events.

Twitter is probably the most effective medium for keeping your followers up to date. Bear in mind that different types of events might be suited to different social media sites. Consider using Facebook, Google+, or Meetup as well as Twitter. Try out different platforms, but don't create extra work for yourself. If asocial media site is unlikely to work for you, or you can't be sure that you can spare the time to look after it, don't use it.

Follow other Jams and members of the Pi community on Twitter and other networks. Retweet and share relevant content created by community members, particularly those in your area. Share successful events, ask for help, and provide help to others when you can. Social media can be a great tool for bringing people together to solve problems.

Make sure that you set up dedicated accounts for your Jam don't use your own personal accounts, and don't use the Jam account as your personal account. Keep the content of your social media relevant to the Jam, and suitable for all ages. Make sure that any accounts you set up can be used by others on your Jam organisation team, and transferred to someone else if you decide to hand over the running of the event.

*When I started the Jam, I just used Eventbrite. After a few events, I set up a WordPress site and a Twitter account. Eventually I registered a domain name and moved the site from wordpress.com to the server hosting my personal blog, so it didn't cost me anything to run. I would update the website with event information for newcomers, and regularly blogged links to interesting Pi projects from members of our local community.*

*You don't have to have all these things to begin with, but it makes sense to build up your web and social media presence over time as your Jam grows. Starting with a Twitter account is an easy way to put the word out without making lots of work for yourself.*

**Ben Nuttall** — Manchester Raspberry Jam

*After running my first few Jams at the Raspberry Pi offices, I was struggling for volunteers for my next event. I reached out to Mike, who runs the big Cambridge Jam, to ask if any of his volunteers could help out. Within an hour I had over ten offers of help, thanks to a quick email he sent round. It's great to have the support of other Jam teams.*

### Start a mailing list

*Now that you've established your Jam, you should aim to maintain contact with people who attended, and set up a mailing list so that new people can register for updates, and hear when you announce future events.*

*The community is so supportive and it is nice to be part of that.*

**Scott Turner** — Northamptonshire Raspberry Jam

*Having a staff mailing list for all your active volunteers really helps: mailmanlists.net run email discussion lists, and they give free accounts to worthy causes like Raspberry Jams.*

### Create a website

Once your Jam is established, you could create a website to give you a permanent presence online. This is not essential, but it can be useful for people to search for your Jam and find a permanent home page. Your website could link to your Eventbrite listings, and your social media channels. You could even maintain a blog about your activities.

You don't need to spend ages designing and developing a website from scratch. Start with something simple like wordpress.com. Setting up your own domain is not essential, and can come later. If you don't want to rush into creating a website, you can take a look at other Jams' websites for inspiration.

Take a look at these Jam websites for inspiration and ideas:

- Manchester Raspberry Jam: mcrraspjam.org.uk
- CamJam: camjam.me
- Raspberry Jam Berlin: raspberryjamberlin.de
- PiCymru: picymru.org.uk

###Create a logo

A logo will give a sense of identity to your Jam. You can use the Raspberry Jam logo created by our designers at Pi Towers, which has been designed to allow you to include the name of your Jam if you wish. Alternatively, you can create your own: many Jam logos are created by members of the community and adapted for different purposes.

The Raspberry Jam Branding Pack includes the logo, fonts, templates, and usage guidelines. You can download it from rpf.io/jambrand. Please observe the usage guidelines, and note that you must not incorporate the Raspberry Pi logo into any design that you create. The Raspberry Pi logo is trademarked, and reserved for official Raspberry Pi partners.

### Frequency

Having run your first Jam, you may find that you are happy to run an event every month. This is great news for local digital makers, offering a regular opportunity to meet new and returning members of your community. Bigger Jams tend to run less often, as they take a lot more time and effort to run. Look at your options and decide what makes sense for you.

### Feedback

It is important to keep your Jam focused on the people who attend, while being welcoming to newcomers. Put together a survey after your first event. Ask people what they expect from the Jam. Do they need practical help? Would they prefer workshops, beginner sessions, or talks? Ask them which workshops, talks, or other activities they enjoyed. Use Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to create and distribute surveys quickly and easily.

### Raspberry Jam network

Use the Raspberry Jam Google+ and Slack communities to stay connected with other Jam organisers, share experiences, and ask for help. Google+ and Slack community members are the first to hear about Jam developments from the Foundation, and your feedback will help to shape the support we provide.

Share your experiences on Twitter and other social media. Help others to get involved in Jams, and celebrate the successes of your Jam and your participants. Use the #rjam hashtag in your tweets. Many Jam organisers (and the Foundation team) monitor this hashtag, and will often retweet or answer calls for help.

Just being able to chat on Slack with people who have more experience of Jams has made me more confident in running one. I think, "If they can do this, so can I!" Also, I often read a message that's for someone else and learn something useful to me, e.g. about paying for the room and equipment, or running a raffle.

**Anne Carlill** — York Raspberry Jam

Ever since setting up the Raspberry Jam Slack community, I've found it to be a great way for Jam organisers to find and support each other. Before I've even had my morning coffee, someone will have asked a question, and it will have several helpful answers. Much better than everyone waiting for me to check my email inbox.
