CHAPTER SIX: PLANNING THE BIG DAY

Volunteers
To run your event, you are going to need as many volunteers and helpers as you
can find. Ask existing members of the Raspberry Pi community to help you run
the event. You could also look for helpers in the wider digital making community:
Code Clubs, CoderDojos, hackerspaces, and other tech groups.
Helpers are important. Workshop leaders will appreciate a second pair of hands,
speakers will need someone to introduce them and manage timings, beginner
sessions need people to guide newcomers. If you are checking people into the
event, you will need volunteers helping on the door. The more volunteers you
have, the easier everything will be, and the less each person will have to do.
It is good practice to waive the ticket fee for helpers. Make sure your helpers know
what their roles are, and that they are happy with their tasks. Make sure your
helpers feel appreciated and valued, and that they are able to enjoy the event as
well as taking part. Name badges are useful for both the helpers and attendees,
and will help your volunteers to feel part of your team. Make it obvious who the
helpers are, and make sure attendees know who they can go to for help.

Our volunteers have badges that say
‘Jam Maker' on them. Sometimes we
have lanyards. Tim and I tend to wear
our purple CamJam polo shirts. They
weren't cheap, but we do stand out!

Help volunteers to stand out with crew t-shirts

The more volunteers you have, the easier everything will be.

Schedule
If your Jam features scheduled activities, draw up a timetable for the day. If you can,
share it with attendees before the event. Display your schedule in the venue on the
day, on screens or posters, to help people to plan their activities.

Checking in
If you want to check your attendees into the event, print out a list from your
Eventbrite page, and ask a volunteer to tick people off as they arrive. You can also
check people in on a laptop using the Eventbrite website, or on a tablet or phone
using the Eventbrite app. Give out name badges to attendees (a sticky label will do).
This will make them feel more welcome, and encourage them to socialise with other
people at the Jam.
If you are taking photos for social media, ask your attendees (especially parents) at
check-in for their permission to use photos online. If anyone refuses permission, let
your photographers know. Giving these people a name badge in a different colour will
help the photographers to spot people who don't want to be in photos, both at the
event, and when they are reviewing their images later.

We have a main check-in desk by
the front door. As folks come in,
they are checked off the Eventbrite
list by someone searching for
names on one of the laptops, or by
scanning their ticket via the mobile
app. As well as the main Eventbrite
attendee list, we also maintain a
separate list as people arrive, so
that we know who is in the building
in case of a fire.

We use the Eventbrite
app to check in attendees
where possible. However,
people tend to arrive all at
once and we don't like a
queue. If it's not possible
to scan the tickets, we just
check them as they come
in. It means our numbers
are a little off, but it keeps
people happier.

Catering
Some Jams use part of the ticket price to provide catering. Others collect donations
and order pizza on the day. If your venue has a café, make sure it is open and
accessible to your attendees. Water, tea, coffee, juice, and biscuits will keep most
people happy during the event.
Whether or not you provide catering, your attendees will need access to food and
drink. Provide information on nearby shops and cafés and set up a re-entry system
to allow people to go out for refreshments. If your venue is on a high street, or
close to plenty of shops and cafés, it might be easier to ask people to source their
own food.
If you are providing food, make sure you have an allergy policy. You can't assume that
everyone can eat what you provide, and it might not be obvious whether allergens
are present. This uncertainty could mean that some attendees are unable to eat, or it
could lead to a serious allergic reaction. Ask people to provide details of their allergies
and other dietary requirements in advance, and think about how you are going to
cater for them.

Providing a variety of pizza for all your attendees

We searched online for caterers in a 30-mile radius of the CamJam
venue, and managed to find someone who would attend the event
free of charge. For Pi Wars, at the Cambridge Computer Lab, we
are obliged to use their internal catering which costs us £200 per
day to cover staffing costs. It's very convenient, for us and the
attendees, and we know we can build that into the ticket price.

We're not allowed food and drink inside our venue. The event starts
at 1pm so we advise people to eat before they arrive, and we point
out some local cafés.

I took inspiration from other tech events I attended, and simply
ordered pizza on the day of the event. Using money collected
from donations and sponsorship, I would order as many pizzas as I
thought we'd need, ensuring we had veggie options, and I'd tweet
the order progress URL so people could follow along. While we
waited for the pizza, I'd ask a volunteer to nip to the shop to buy a
few large bottles of soft drink.
